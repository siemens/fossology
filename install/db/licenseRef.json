By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users. This General Public License applies to most of the Free Software Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to using it. (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.) You can apply it to your programs, too.\r\n\r\nWhen we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.\r\n\r\nTo protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.\r\n\r\nFor example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\r\n\r\nWe protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and\/or modify the software.\r\n\r\nAlso, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free software. If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original authors' reputations.\r\n\r\nFinally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents. We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.\r\n\r\nThe precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.\r\n\r\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\r\n\r\n0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms of this General Public License. The \"Program\", below, refers to any such program or work, and a \"work based on the Program\" means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and\/or translated into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term \"modification\".) Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".\r\n\r\nActivities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Program (independent of having been made by running the Program). Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.\r\n\r\n1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License along with the Program.\r\n\r\nYou may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\r\n\r\n2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\r\n\r\na) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\r\nb) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.\r\nc) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when run, you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this License. (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on the Program is not required to print an announcement.)\r\nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\r\n\r\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on the Program.\r\n\r\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this License.\r\n\r\n3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:\r\n\r\na) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\r\nb) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\r\nc) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the program in object code or executable form with such an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)\r\nThe source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the executable. However, as a special exception, the source code distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable.\r\n\r\nIf distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code.\r\n\r\n4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.\r\n\r\n5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Program or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Program or works based on it.\r\n\r\n6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License.\r\n\r\n7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.\r\n\r\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.\r\n\r\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software distribution system, which is implemented by public license practices. Many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to the author\/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.\r\n\r\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of the rest of this License.\r\n\r\n8. If the distribution and\/or use of the Program is restricted in certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Program under this License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this License.\r\n\r\n9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and\/or new versions of the General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\r\n\r\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and \"any later version\", you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.\r\n\r\n10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.\r\n\r\nNO WARRANTY\r\n\r\n11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND\/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\r\n\r\n12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND\/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\r\n\r\nEND OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\r\n\r\nHow to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\r\n\r\nIf you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\r\n\r\nTo do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\r\n\r\none line to give the program's name and an idea of what it does.\r\nCopyright (C) yyyy name of author\r\n\r\nThis program is free software; you can redistribute it and\/or\r\nmodify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License\r\nas published by the Free Software Foundation; either version 2\r\nof the License, or (at your option) any later version.\r\n\r\nThis program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\r\nbut WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\r\nMERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the\r\nGNU General Public License for more details.\r\n\r\nYou should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License\r\nalong with this program; if not, write to the Free Software\r\nFoundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301, USA.\r\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\r\n\r\nIf the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:\r\n\r\nGnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author\r\nGnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details\r\ntype `show w'. This is free software, and you are welcome\r\nto redistribute it under certain conditions; type `show c'\r\nfor details.\r\nThe hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate parts of the General Public License. Of course, the commands you use may be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.\r\n\r\nYou should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your school, if any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if necessary. Here is a sample; alter the names:\r\n\r\nYoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright\r\ninterest in the program `Gnomovision'\r\n(which makes passes at compilers) written\r\nby James Hacker.\r\n\r\nsignature of Ty Coon, 1 April 1989\r\nTy Coon, President of Vice\r\nThis General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine library, you may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the library. If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General Public License instead of this License. ",

This License Agreement applies to any program or other work which\r\ncontains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be\r\ndistributed under the terms of this General Public License. The\r\n\"Program\", below, refers to any such program or work, and a \"work based\r\non the Program\" means either the Program or any work containing the\r\nProgram or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications. Each\r\nlicensee is addressed as \"you\".\r\n\r\n1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source\r\ncode as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and\r\nappropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and\r\ndisclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this\r\nGeneral Public License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any\r\nother recipients of the Program a copy of this General Public License\r\nalong with the Program. You may charge a fee for the physical act of\r\ntransferring a copy.\r\n\r\n2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of\r\nit, and copy and distribute such modifications under the terms of Paragraph\r\n1 above, provided that you also do the following:\r\n\r\na) cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that\r\nyou changed the files and the date of any change; and\r\n\r\nb) cause the whole of any work that you distribute or publish, that\r\nin whole or in part contains the Program or any part thereof, either\r\nwith or without modifications, to be licensed at no charge to all\r\nthird parties under the terms of this General Public License (except\r\nthat you may choose to grant warranty protection to some or all\r\nthird parties, at your option).\r\n\r\nc) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when\r\nrun, you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use\r\nin the simplest and most usual way, to print or display an\r\nannouncement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice\r\nthat there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a\r\nwarranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these\r\nconditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this General\r\nPublic License.\r\n\r\nd) You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a\r\ncopy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in\r\nexchange for a fee.\r\n\r\nMere aggregation of another independent work with the Program (or its\r\nderivative) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring\r\nthe other work under the scope of these terms.\r\n\r\n3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a portion or derivative of\r\nit, under Paragraph 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of\r\nParagraphs 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:\r\n\r\na) accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable\r\nsource code, which must be distributed under the terms of\r\nParagraphs 1 and 2 above; or,\r\n\r\nb) accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three\r\nyears, to give any third party free (except for a nominal charge\r\nfor the cost of distribution) a complete machine-readable copy of the\r\ncorresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of\r\nParagraphs 1 and 2 above; or,\r\n\r\nc) accompany it with the information you received as to where the\r\ncorresponding source code may be obtained. (This alternative is\r\nallowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you\r\nreceived the program in object code or executable form alone.)\r\n\r\nSource code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making\r\nmodifications to it. For an executable file, complete source code means\r\nall the source code for all modules it contains; but, as a special\r\nexception, it need not include source code for modules which are standard\r\nlibraries that accompany the operating system on which the executable\r\nfile runs, or for standard header files or definitions files that\r\naccompany that operating system.\r\n\r\n4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, distribute or transfer the\r\nProgram except as expressly provided under this General Public License.\r\nAny attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, distribute or transfer\r\nthe Program is void, and will automatically terminate your rights to use\r\nthe Program under this License. However, parties who have received\r\ncopies, or rights to use copies, from you under this General Public\r\nLicense will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties\r\nremain in full compliance.\r\n\r\n5. By copying, distributing or modifying the Program (or any work based\r\non the Program) you indicate your acceptance of this license to do so,\r\nand all its terms and conditions.\r\n\r\n6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the\r\nProgram), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original\r\nlicensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these\r\nterms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the\r\nrecipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\r\n\r\n7.

IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\r\nWILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND\/OR\r\nREDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,\r\nINCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING\r\nOUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED\r\nTO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY\r\nYOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER\r\nPROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE\r\nPOSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\r\n\r\nEND OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\r\n\r\nAppendix: How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\r\n\r\nIf you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest\r\npossible use to humanity, the best way to achieve this is to make it\r\nfree software which everyone can redistribute and change under these\r\nterms.\r\n\r\nTo do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to\r\nattach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey\r\nthe exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the\r\n\"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\r\n\r\n<one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\r\nCopyright (C) 19yy <name of author>\r\n\r\nThis program is free software; you can redistribute it and\/or modify\r\nit under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\r\nthe Free Software Foundation; either version 1, or (at your option)\r\nany later version.\r\n\r\nThis program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\r\nbut WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\r\nMERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the\r\nGNU General Public License for more details.\r\n\r\nYou should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License\r\nalong with this program; if not, write to the Free Software\r\nFoundation, Inc., 675 Mass Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA.\r\n\r\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\r\n\r\nIf the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this\r\nwhen it starts in an interactive mode:\r\n\r\nGnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) 19xx name of author\r\nGnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.\r\nThis is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it\r\nunder certain conditions; type `show c' for details.\r\n\r\nThe hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the\r\nappropriate parts of the General Public License. Of course, the\r\ncommands you use may be called something other than `show w' and `show\r\nc'; they could even be mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your\r\nprogram.\r\n\r\nYou should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your\r\nschool, if any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if\r\nnecessary. Here a sample; alter the names:\r\n\r\nYoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the\r\nprogram `Gnomovision' (a program to direct compilers to make passes\r\nat assemblers) written by James Hacker.\r\n\r\n<signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1989\r\nTy Coon, President of Vice\r\n\r\nThat's all there is to it!

By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free software for all its users. We, the Free Software Foundation, use the GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to any other work released this way by its authors. You can apply it to your programs, too.\r\n\r\nWhen we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs, and that you know you can do these things.\r\n\r\nTo protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you these rights or asking you to surrender the rights. Therefore, you have certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.\r\n\r\nFor example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same freedoms that you received. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\r\n\r\nDevelopers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps: (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and\/or modify it.\r\n\r\nFor the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains that there is no warranty for this free software. For both users' and authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to authors of previous versions.\r\n\r\nSome devices are designed to deny users access to install or run modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer can do so. This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of protecting users' freedom to change the software. The systematic pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable. Therefore, we have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those products. If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.\r\n\r\nFinally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents. States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could make it effectively proprietary. To prevent this, the GPL assures that patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.\r\n\r\nThe precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.\r\n\r\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS\r\n\r\n0. Definitions.\r\n\"This License\" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.\r\n\r\n\"Copyright\" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of works, such as semiconductor masks.\r\n\r\n\"The Program\" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this License. Each licensee is addressed as \"you\". \"Licensees\" and \"recipients\" may be individuals or organizations.\r\n\r\nTo \"modify\" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an exact copy. The resulting work is called a \"modified version\" of the earlier work or a work \"based on\" the earlier work.\r\n\r\nA \"covered work\" means either the unmodified Program or a work based on the Program.\r\n\r\nTo \"propagate\" a work means to do anything with it that, without permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a computer or modifying a private copy. Propagation includes copying, distribution (with or without modification), making available to the public, and in some countries other activities as well.\r\n\r\nTo \"convey\" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other parties to make or receive copies. Mere interaction with a user through a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.\r\n\r\nAn interactive user interface displays \"Appropriate Legal Notices\" to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2) tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License. If the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.\r\n\r\n1. Source Code.\r\nThe \"source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. \"Object code\" means any non-source form of a work.\r\n\r\nA \"Standard Interface\" means an interface that either is an official standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that is widely used among developers working in that language.\r\n\r\nThe \"System Libraries\" of an executable work include anything, other than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an implementation is available to the public in source code form. A \"Major Component\", in this context, means a major essential component (kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system (if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.\r\n\r\nThe \"Corresponding Source\" for a work in object code form means all the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to control those activities. However, it does not include the work's System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but which are not part of the work. For example, Corresponding Source includes interface definition files associated with source files for the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require, such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those subprograms and other parts of the work.\r\n\r\nThe Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding Source.\r\n\r\nThe Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that same work.\r\n\r\n2. Basic Permissions.\r\nAll rights granted under this License are granted for the term of copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated conditions are met. This License explicitly affirms your unlimited permission to run the unmodified Program. The output from running a covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its content, constitutes a covered work. This License acknowledges your rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.\r\n\r\nYou may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains in force. You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do not control copyright. Those thus making or running the covered works for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.\r\n\r\nConveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under the conditions stated below. Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10 makes it unnecessary.\r\n\r\n3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.\r\nNo covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article 11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such measures.\r\n\r\nWhen you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of technological measures.\r\n\r\n4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.\r\nYou may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice; keep intact all notices stating that this License and any non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code; keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.\r\n\r\nYou may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey, and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.\r\n\r\n5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.\r\nYou may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\r\n\r\na) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified it, and giving a relevant date.\r\nb) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is released under this License and any conditions added under section 7. This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to \"keep intact all notices\".\r\nc) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy. This License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7 additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts, regardless of how they are packaged. This License gives no permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.\r\nd) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your work need not make them do so.\r\nA compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work, and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an \"aggregate\" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users beyond what the individual works permit. Inclusion of a covered work in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other parts of the aggregate.\r\n\r\n6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.\r\nYou may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, in one of these ways:\r\n\r\na) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange.\r\nb) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.\r\nc) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the written offer to provide the Corresponding Source. This alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord with subsection 6b.\r\nd) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no further charge. You need not require recipients to copy the Corresponding Source along with the object code. If the place to copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party) that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the Corresponding Source. Regardless of what server hosts the Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.\r\ne) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no charge under subsection 6d.\r\nA separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be included in conveying the object code work.\r\n\r\nA \"User Product\" is either (1) a \"consumer product\", which means any tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family, or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation into a dwelling. In determining whether a product is a consumer product, doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage. For a particular product received by a particular user, \"normally used\" refers to a typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product. A product is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent the only significant mode of use of the product.\r\n\r\n\"Installation Information\" for a User Product means any methods, procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from a modified version of its Corresponding Source. The information must suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because modification has been made.\r\n\r\nIf you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied by the Installation Information. But this requirement does not apply if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has been installed in ROM).\r\n\r\nThe requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for the User Product in which it has been modified or installed. Access to a network may be denied when the modification itself materially and adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and protocols for communication across the network.\r\n\r\nCorresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided, in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly documented (and with an implementation available to the public in source code form), and must require no special password or key for unpacking, reading or copying.\r\n\r\n7. Additional Terms.\r\n\"Additional permissions\" are terms that supplement the terms of this License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions. Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent that they are valid under applicable law. If additional permissions apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by this License without regard to the additional permissions.\r\n\r\nWhen you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of it. (Additional permissions may be written to require their own removal in certain cases when you modify the work.) You may place additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work, for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:\r\n\r\na) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or\r\nb) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal Notices displayed by works containing it; or\r\nc) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in reasonable ways as different from the original version; or\r\nd) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or authors of the material; or\r\ne) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or\r\nf) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on those licensors and authors.\r\nAll other non-permissive additional terms are considered \"further restrictions\" within the meaning of section 10. If the Program as you received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is governed by this License along with a term that is a further restriction, you may remove that term. If a license document contains a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms of that license document, provided that the further restriction does not survive such relicensing or conveying.\r\n\r\nIf you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating where to find the applicable terms.\r\n\r\nAdditional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions; the above requirements apply either way.\r\n\r\n8. Termination.\r\nYou may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to propagate or modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third paragraph of section 11).\r\n\r\nHowever, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.\r\n\r\nMoreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice.\r\n\r\nTermination of your rights under this section does not terminate the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under this License. If your rights have been terminated and not permanently reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same material under section 10.\r\n\r\n9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.\r\nYou are not required to accept this License in order to receive or run a copy of the Program. Ancillary propagation of a covered work occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance. However, nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or modify any covered work. These actions infringe copyright if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or propagating a covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.\r\n\r\n10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.\r\nEach time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and propagate that work, subject to this License. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.\r\n\r\nAn \"entity transaction\" is a transaction transferring control of an organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an organization, or merging organizations. If propagation of a covered work results from an entity transaction, each party to that transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.\r\n\r\nYou may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the rights granted or affirmed under this License. For example, you may not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.\r\n\r\n11. Patents.\r\nA \"contributor\" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based. The work thus licensed is called the contributor's \"contributor version\".\r\n\r\nA contributor's \"essential patent claims\" are all patent claims owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version, but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a consequence of further modification of the contributor version. For purposes of this definition, \"control\" includes the right to grant patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License.\r\n\r\nEach contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and propagate the contents of its contributor version.\r\n\r\nIn the following three paragraphs, a \"patent license\" is any express agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent (such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to sue for patent infringement). To \"grant\" such a patent license to a party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a patent against the party.\r\n\r\nIf you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license, and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a publicly available network server or other readily accessible means, then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent license to downstream recipients. \"Knowingly relying\" means you have actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that country that you have reason to believe are valid.\r\n\r\nIf, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered work and works based on it.\r\n\r\nA patent license is \"discriminatory\" if it does not include within the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are specifically granted under this License. You may not convey a covered work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily for and in connection with specific products or compilations that contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement, or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.\r\n\r\nNothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.\r\n\r\n12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.\r\nIf conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot convey a covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not convey it at all. For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.\r\n\r\n13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.\r\nNotwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single combined work, and to convey the resulting work. The terms of this License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work, but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License, section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the combination as such.\r\n\r\n14. Revised Versions of this License.\r\nThe Free Software Foundation may publish revised and\/or new versions of the GNU General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\r\n\r\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General Public License \"or any later version\" applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of the GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.\r\n\r\nIf the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the Program.\r\n\r\nLater license versions may give you additional or different permissions. However, no additional obligations are imposed on any author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a later version.\r\n\r\n15. Disclaimer of Warranty.\r\nTHERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND\/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\r\n\r\n16. Limitation of Liability.\r\nIN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND\/OR CONVEYS THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\r\n\r\n17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.\r\nIf the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms, reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a copy of the Program in return for a fee.\r\n\r\nEND OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\r\n\r\nHow to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\r\nIf you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\r\n\r\nTo do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\r\n\r\n<one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\r\nCopyright (C) <year> <name of author>\r\n\r\nThis program is free software: you can redistribute it and\/or modify\r\nit under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\r\nthe Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or\r\n(at your option) any later version.\r\n\r\nThis program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\r\nbut WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\r\nMERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the\r\nGNU General Public License for more details.\r\n\r\nYou should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License\r\nalong with this program. If not, see <http:\/\/www.gnu.org\/licenses\/>.\r\n\r\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\r\n\r\nIf the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:\r\n\r\n<program> Copyright (C) <year> <name of author>\r\nThis program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type 'show w'.\r\nThis is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it\r\nunder certain conditions; type 'show c' for details.\r\n\r\nThe hypothetical commands 'show w' and 'show c' should show the appropriate parts of the General Public License. Of course, your program's commands might be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an \"about box\".\r\n\r\nYou should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school, if any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if necessary. For more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see <http:\/\/www.gnu.org\/licenses\/>.\r\n\r\nThe GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine library, you may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the library. If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General Public License instead of this License. But first, please read <http:\/\/www.gnu.org\/philosophy\/why-not-lgpl.html>.",

It is\r\nnumbered 2 because it goes with version 2 of the ordinary GPL.]\r\nPreamble\r\n\r\nThe licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.\r\n\r\nThis license, the Library General Public License, applies to some specially designated Free Software Foundation software, and to any other libraries whose authors decide to use it. You can use it for your libraries, too.\r\n\r\nWhen we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.\r\n\r\nTo protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the library, or if you modify it.\r\n\r\nFor example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave you. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. If you link a program with the library, you must provide complete object files to the recipients so that they can relink them with the library, after making changes to the library and recompiling it. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\r\n\r\nOur method of protecting your rights has two steps: (1) copyright the library, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and\/or modify the library.\r\n\r\nAlso, for each distributor's protection, we want to make certain that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free library. If the library is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original version, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original authors' reputations.\r\n\r\nFinally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents. We wish to avoid the danger that companies distributing free software will individually obtain patent licenses, thus in effect transforming the program into proprietary software. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.\r\n\r\nMost GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary GNU General Public License, which was designed for utility programs. This license, the GNU Library General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries. This license is quite different from the ordinary one; be sure to read it in full, and don't assume that anything in it is the same as in the ordinary license.\r\n\r\nThe reason we have a separate public license for some libraries is that they blur the distinction we usually make between modifying or adding to a program and simply using it. Linking a program with a library, without changing the library, is in some sense simply using the library, and is analogous to running a utility program or application program. However, in a textual and legal sense, the linked executable is a combined work, a derivative of the original library, and the ordinary General Public License treats it as such.\r\n\r\nBecause of this blurred distinction, using the ordinary General Public License for libraries did not effectively promote software sharing, because most developers did not use the libraries. We concluded that weaker conditions might promote sharing better.\r\n\r\nHowever, unrestricted linking of non-free programs would deprive the users of those programs of all benefit from the free status of the libraries themselves. This Library General Public License is intended to permit developers of non-free programs to use free libraries, while preserving your freedom as a user of such programs to change the free libraries that are incorporated in them. (We have not seen how to achieve this as regards changes in header files, but we have achieved it as regards changes in the actual functions of the Library.) The hope is that this will lead to faster development of free libraries.\r\n\r\nThe precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow. Pay close attention to the difference between a \"work based on the library\" and a \"work that uses the library\". The former contains code derived from the library, while the latter only works together with the library.\r\n\r\nNote that it is possible for a library to be covered by the ordinary General Public License rather than by this special one.\r\n\r\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\r\n\r\n0. This License Agreement applies to any software library which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of this Library General Public License (also called \"this License\"). Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".\r\n\r\nA \"library\" means a collection of software functions and\/or data prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs (which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.\r\n\r\nThe \"Library\", below, refers to any such software library or work which has been distributed under these terms. A \"work based on the Library\" means either the Library or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and\/or translated straightforwardly into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term \"modification\".)\r\n\r\n\"Source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. For a library, complete source code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the library.\r\n\r\nActivities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for writing it). Whether that is true depends on what the Library does and what the program that uses the Library does.\r\n\r\n1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the Library.\r\n\r\nYou may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\r\n\r\n2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\r\n\r\na) The modified work must itself be a software library.\r\nb) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\r\nc) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.\r\nd) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that, in the event an application does not supply such function or table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful.\r\n(For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the application. Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any application-supplied function or table used by this function must be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square root function must still compute square roots.)\r\n\r\nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\r\n\r\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on the Library.\r\n\r\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this License.\r\n\r\n3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library. To do this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2, instead of to this License. (If a newer version than version 2 of the ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify that version instead if you wish.) Do not make any other change in these notices.\r\n\r\nOnce this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.\r\n\r\nThis option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of the Library into a program that is not a library.\r\n\r\n4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange.\r\n\r\nIf distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to distribute the source code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code.\r\n\r\n5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or linked with it, is called a \"work that uses the Library\". Such a work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and therefore falls outside the scope of this License.\r\n\r\nHowever, linking a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it contains portions of the Library), rather than a \"work that uses the library\". The executable is therefore covered by this License. Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.\r\n\r\nWhen a \"work that uses the Library\" uses material from a header file that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not. Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library. The threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.\r\n\r\nIf such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative work. (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the Library will still fall under Section 6.)\r\n\r\nOtherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6. Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6, whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.\r\n\r\n6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also compile or link a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library to produce a work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse engineering for debugging such modifications.\r\n\r\nYou must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License. You must supply a copy of this License. If the work during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference directing the user to the copy of this License. Also, you must do one of these things:\r\n\r\na) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked with the Library, with the complete machine-readable \"work that uses the Library\", as object code and\/or source code, so that the user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified executable containing the modified Library. (It is understood that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application to use the modified definitions.)\r\nb) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give the same user the materials specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more than the cost of performing this distribution.\r\nc) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above specified materials from the same place.\r\nd) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.\r\nFor an executable, the required form of the \"work that uses the Library\" must include any data and utility programs needed for reproducing the executable from it. However, as a special exception, the source code distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable.\r\n\r\nIt may happen that this requirement contradicts the license restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally accompany the operating system. Such a contradiction means you cannot use both them and the Library together in an executable that you distribute.\r\n\r\n7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise permitted, and provided that you do these two things:\r\n\r\na) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities. This must be distributed under the terms of the Sections above.\r\nb) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.\r\n8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.\r\n\r\n9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Library or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Library or works based on it.\r\n\r\n10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License.\r\n\r\n11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Library at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.\r\n\r\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply, and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.\r\n\r\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software distribution system which is implemented by public license practices. Many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to the author\/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.\r\n\r\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of the rest of this License.\r\n\r\n12. If the distribution and\/or use of the Library is restricted in certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this License.\r\n\r\n13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and\/or new versions of the Library General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\r\n\r\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and \"any later version\", you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library does not specify a license version number, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.\r\n\r\n14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these, write to the author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.\r\n\r\nNO WARRANTY\r\n\r\n15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND\/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE LIBRARY IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\r\n\r\n16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND\/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\r\n\r\nEND OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\r\n\r\nHow to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries\r\n\r\nIf you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that everyone can redistribute and change. You can do so by permitting redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the ordinary General Public License).\r\n\r\nTo apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library. It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\r\n\r\none line to give the library's name and an idea of what it does.\r\nCopyright (C) year name of author\r\n\r\nThis library is free software; you can redistribute it and\/or\r\nmodify it under the terms of the GNU Library General Public\r\nLicense as published by the Free Software Foundation; either\r\nversion 2 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.\r\n\r\nThis library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\r\nbut WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\r\nMERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU\r\nLibrary General Public License for more details.\r\n\r\nYou should have received a copy of the GNU Library General Public\r\nLicense along with this library; if not, write to the\r\nFree Software Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin St, Fifth Floor,\r\nBoston, MA 02110-1301, USA.\r\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\r\n\r\nYou should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your school, if any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the library, if necessary. Here is a sample; alter the names:\r\n\r\nYoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in\r\nthe library `Frob' (a library for tweaking knobs) written\r\nby James Random Hacker.\r\n\r\nsignature of Ty Coon, 1 April 1990\r\nTy Coon, President of Vice\r\nThat's all there is to it!

It is\r\nnumbered 2 because it goes with version 2 of the ordinary GPL.]\r\nPreamble\r\n\r\nThe licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.\r\n\r\nThis license, the Library General Public License, applies to some specially designated Free Software Foundation software, and to any other libraries whose authors decide to use it. You can use it for your libraries, too.\r\n\r\nWhen we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.\r\n\r\nTo protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the library, or if you modify it.\r\n\r\nFor example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave you. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. If you link a program with the library, you must provide complete object files to the recipients so that they can relink them with the library, after making changes to the library and recompiling it. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\r\n\r\nOur method of protecting your rights has two steps: (1) copyright the library, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and\/or modify the library.\r\n\r\nAlso, for each distributor's protection, we want to make certain that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free library. If the library is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original version, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original authors' reputations.\r\n\r\nFinally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents. We wish to avoid the danger that companies distributing free software will individually obtain patent licenses, thus in effect transforming the program into proprietary software. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.\r\n\r\nMost GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary GNU General Public License, which was designed for utility programs. This license, the GNU Library General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries. This license is quite different from the ordinary one; be sure to read it in full, and don't assume that anything in it is the same as in the ordinary license.\r\n\r\nThe reason we have a separate public license for some libraries is that they blur the distinction we usually make between modifying or adding to a program and simply using it. Linking a program with a library, without changing the library, is in some sense simply using the library, and is analogous to running a utility program or application program. However, in a textual and legal sense, the linked executable is a combined work, a derivative of the original library, and the ordinary General Public License treats it as such.\r\n\r\nBecause of this blurred distinction, using the ordinary General Public License for libraries did not effectively promote software sharing, because most developers did not use the libraries. We concluded that weaker conditions might promote sharing better.\r\n\r\nHowever, unrestricted linking of non-free programs would deprive the users of those programs of all benefit from the free status of the libraries themselves. This Library General Public License is intended to permit developers of non-free programs to use free libraries, while preserving your freedom as a user of such programs to change the free libraries that are incorporated in them. (We have not seen how to achieve this as regards changes in header files, but we have achieved it as regards changes in the actual functions of the Library.) The hope is that this will lead to faster development of free libraries.\r\n\r\nThe precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow. Pay close attention to the difference between a \"work based on the library\" and a \"work that uses the library\". The former contains code derived from the library, while the latter only works together with the library.\r\n\r\nNote that it is possible for a library to be covered by the ordinary General Public License rather than by this special one.\r\n\r\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\r\n\r\n0. This License Agreement applies to any software library which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of this Library General Public License (also called \"this License\"). Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".\r\n\r\nA \"library\" means a collection of software functions and\/or data prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs (which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.\r\n\r\nThe \"Library\", below, refers to any such software library or work which has been distributed under these terms. A \"work based on the Library\" means either the Library or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and\/or translated straightforwardly into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term \"modification\".)\r\n\r\n\"Source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. For a library, complete source code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the library.\r\n\r\nActivities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for writing it). Whether that is true depends on what the Library does and what the program that uses the Library does.\r\n\r\n1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the Library.\r\n\r\nYou may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\r\n\r\n2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\r\n\r\na) The modified work must itself be a software library.\r\nb) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\r\nc) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.\r\nd) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that, in the event an application does not supply such function or table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful.\r\n(For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the application. Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any application-supplied function or table used by this function must be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square root function must still compute square roots.)\r\n\r\nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\r\n\r\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on the Library.\r\n\r\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this License.\r\n\r\n3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library. To do this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2, instead of to this License. (If a newer version than version 2 of the ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify that version instead if you wish.) Do not make any other change in these notices.\r\n\r\nOnce this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.\r\n\r\nThis option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of the Library into a program that is not a library.\r\n\r\n4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange.\r\n\r\nIf distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to distribute the source code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code.\r\n\r\n5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or linked with it, is called a \"work that uses the Library\". Such a work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and therefore falls outside the scope of this License.\r\n\r\nHowever, linking a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it contains portions of the Library), rather than a \"work that uses the library\". The executable is therefore covered by this License. Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.\r\n\r\nWhen a \"work that uses the Library\" uses material from a header file that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not. Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library. The threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.\r\n\r\nIf such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative work. (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the Library will still fall under Section 6.)\r\n\r\nOtherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6. Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6, whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.\r\n\r\n6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also compile or link a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library to produce a work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse engineering for debugging such modifications.\r\n\r\nYou must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License. You must supply a copy of this License. If the work during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference directing the user to the copy of this License. Also, you must do one of these things:\r\n\r\na) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked with the Library, with the complete machine-readable \"work that uses the Library\", as object code and\/or source code, so that the user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified executable containing the modified Library. (It is understood that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application to use the modified definitions.)\r\nb) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give the same user the materials specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more than the cost of performing this distribution.\r\nc) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above specified materials from the same place.\r\nd) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.\r\nFor an executable, the required form of the \"work that uses the Library\" must include any data and utility programs needed for reproducing the executable from it. However, as a special exception, the source code distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable.\r\n\r\nIt may happen that this requirement contradicts the license restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally accompany the operating system. Such a contradiction means you cannot use both them and the Library together in an executable that you distribute.\r\n\r\n7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise permitted, and provided that you do these two things:\r\n\r\na) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities. This must be distributed under the terms of the Sections above.\r\nb) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.\r\n8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.\r\n\r\n9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Library or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Library or works based on it.\r\n\r\n10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License.\r\n\r\n11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Library at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.\r\n\r\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply, and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.\r\n\r\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software distribution system which is implemented by public license practices. Many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to the author\/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.\r\n\r\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of the rest of this License.\r\n\r\n12. If the distribution and\/or use of the Library is restricted in certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this License.\r\n\r\n13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and\/or new versions of the Library General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\r\n\r\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and \"any later version\", you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library does not specify a license version number, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.\r\n\r\n14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these, write to the author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.\r\n\r\nNO WARRANTY\r\n\r\n15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND\/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE LIBRARY IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\r\n\r\n16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND\/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\r\n\r\nEND OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\r\n\r\nHow to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries\r\n\r\nIf you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that everyone can redistribute and change. You can do so by permitting redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the ordinary General Public License).\r\n\r\nTo apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library. It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\r\n\r\none line to give the library's name and an idea of what it does.\r\nCopyright (C) year name of author\r\n\r\nThis library is free software; you can redistribute it and\/or\r\nmodify it under the terms of the GNU Library General Public\r\nLicense as published by the Free Software Foundation; either\r\nversion 2 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.\r\n\r\nThis library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\r\nbut WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\r\nMERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU\r\nLibrary General Public License for more details.\r\n\r\nYou should have received a copy of the GNU Library General Public\r\nLicense along with this library; if not, write to the\r\nFree Software Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin St, Fifth Floor,\r\nBoston, MA 02110-1301, USA.\r\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\r\n\r\nYou should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your school, if any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the library, if necessary. Here is a sample; alter the names:\r\n\r\nYoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in\r\nthe library `Frob' (a library for tweaking knobs) written\r\nby James Random Hacker.\r\n\r\nsignature of Ty Coon, 1 April 1990\r\nTy Coon, President of Vice\r\nThat's all there is to it!

It also counts\r\nas the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence\r\nthe version number 2.1.]\r\n\r\nPreamble\r\n\r\nThe licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.\r\n\r\nThis license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it. You can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.\r\n\r\nWhen we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do these things.\r\n\r\nTo protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.\r\n\r\nFor example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave you. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. If you link other code with the library, you must provide complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling it. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\r\n\r\nWe protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and\/or modify the library.\r\n\r\nTo protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that there is no warranty for the free library. Also, if the library is modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know that what they have is not the original version, so that the original author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be introduced by others.\r\n\r\nFinally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of any free program. We wish to make sure that a company cannot effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a restrictive license from a patent holder. Therefore, we insist that any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.\r\n\r\nMost GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary GNU General Public License. This license, the GNU Lesser General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and is quite different from the ordinary General Public License. We use this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those libraries into non-free programs.\r\n\r\nWhen a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a combined work, a derivative of the original library. The ordinary General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the entire combination fits its criteria of freedom. The Lesser General Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with the library.\r\n\r\nWe call this license the \"Lesser\" General Public License because it does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General Public License. It also provides other free software developers Less of an advantage over competing non-free programs. These disadvantages are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many libraries. However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain special circumstances.\r\n\r\nFor example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes a de-facto standard. To achieve this, non-free programs must be allowed to use the library. A more frequent case is that a free library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries. In this case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.\r\n\r\nIn other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of free software. For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU\/Linux operating system.\r\n\r\nAlthough the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run that program using a modified version of the Library.\r\n\r\nThe precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow. Pay close attention to the difference between a \"work based on the library\" and a \"work that uses the library\". The former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must be combined with the library in order to run.\r\n\r\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\r\n\r\n0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of this Lesser General Public License (also called \"this License\"). Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".\r\n\r\nA \"library\" means a collection of software functions and\/or data prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs (which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.\r\n\r\nThe \"Library\", below, refers to any such software library or work which has been distributed under these terms. A \"work based on the Library\" means either the Library or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and\/or translated straightforwardly into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term \"modification\".)\r\n\r\n\"Source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. For a library, complete source code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the library.\r\n\r\nActivities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for writing it). Whether that is true depends on what the Library does and what the program that uses the Library does.\r\n\r\n1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the Library.\r\n\r\nYou may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\r\n\r\n2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\r\n\r\na) The modified work must itself be a software library.\r\nb) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\r\nc) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.\r\nd) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that, in the event an application does not supply such function or table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful.\r\n(For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the application. Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any application-supplied function or table used by this function must be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square root function must still compute square roots.)\r\n\r\nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\r\n\r\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on the Library.\r\n\r\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this License.\r\n\r\n3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library. To do this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2, instead of to this License. (If a newer version than version 2 of the ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify that version instead if you wish.) Do not make any other change in these notices.\r\n\r\nOnce this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.\r\n\r\nThis option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of the Library into a program that is not a library.\r\n\r\n4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange.\r\n\r\nIf distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to distribute the source code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code.\r\n\r\n5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or linked with it, is called a \"work that uses the Library\". Such a work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and therefore falls outside the scope of this License.\r\n\r\nHowever, linking a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it contains portions of the Library), rather than a \"work that uses the library\". The executable is therefore covered by this License. Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.\r\n\r\nWhen a \"work that uses the Library\" uses material from a header file that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not. Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library. The threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.\r\n\r\nIf such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative work. (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the Library will still fall under Section 6.)\r\n\r\nOtherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6. Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6, whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.\r\n\r\n6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or link a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library to produce a work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse engineering for debugging such modifications.\r\n\r\nYou must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License. You must supply a copy of this License. If the work during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference directing the user to the copy of this License. Also, you must do one of these things:\r\n\r\na) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked with the Library, with the complete machine-readable \"work that uses the Library\", as object code and\/or source code, so that the user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified executable containing the modified Library. (It is understood that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application to use the modified definitions.)\r\nb) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the Library. A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a copy of the library already present on the user's computer system, rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2) will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if the user installs one, as long as the modified version is interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.\r\nc) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give the same user the materials specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more than the cost of performing this distribution.\r\nd) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above specified materials from the same place.\r\ne) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.\r\nFor an executable, the required form of the \"work that uses the Library\" must include any data and utility programs needed for reproducing the executable from it. However, as a special exception, the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable.\r\n\r\nIt may happen that this requirement contradicts the license restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally accompany the operating system. Such a contradiction means you cannot use both them and the Library together in an executable that you distribute.\r\n\r\n7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise permitted, and provided that you do these two things:\r\n\r\na) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities. This must be distributed under the terms of the Sections above.\r\nb) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.\r\n8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.\r\n\r\n9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Library or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Library or works based on it.\r\n\r\n10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.\r\n\r\n11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Library at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.\r\n\r\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply, and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.\r\n\r\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software distribution system which is implemented by public license practices. Many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to the author\/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.\r\n\r\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of the rest of this License.\r\n\r\n12. If the distribution and\/or use of the Library is restricted in certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this License.\r\n\r\n13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and\/or new versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\r\n\r\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and \"any later version\", you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library does not specify a license version number, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.\r\n\r\n14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these, write to the author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.\r\n\r\nNO WARRANTY\r\n\r\n15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND\/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE LIBRARY IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\r\n\r\n16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND\/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\r\n\r\nEND OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\r\n\r\nHow to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries\r\n\r\nIf you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that everyone can redistribute and change. You can do so by permitting redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the ordinary General Public License).\r\n\r\nTo apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library. It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\r\n\r\none line to give the library's name and an idea of what it does.\r\nCopyright (C) year name of author\r\n\r\nThis library is free software; you can redistribute it and\/or\r\nmodify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public\r\nLicense as published by the Free Software Foundation; either\r\nversion 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.\r\n\r\nThis library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\r\nbut WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\r\nMERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU\r\nLesser General Public License for more details.\r\n\r\nYou should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public\r\nLicense along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software\r\nFoundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA\r\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\r\n\r\nYou should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your school, if any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the library, if necessary. Here is a sample; alter the names:\r\n\r\nYoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in\r\nthe library `Frob' (a library for tweaking knobs) written\r\nby James Random Hacker.\r\n\r\nsignature of Ty Coon, 1 April 1990\r\nTy Coon, President of Vice\r\nThat's all there is to it!

Additional Definitions.\r\n\r\nAs used herein, \"this License\" refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser\r\nGeneral Public License, and the \"GNU GPL\" refers to version 3 of the GNU\r\nGeneral Public License.\r\n\r\n\"The Library\" refers to a covered work governed by this License,\r\nother than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.\r\n\r\nAn \"Application\" is any work that makes use of an interface provided\r\nby the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library.\r\nDefining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode\r\nof using an interface provided by the Library.\r\n\r\nA \"Combined Work\" is a work produced by combining or linking an\r\nApplication with the Library. The particular version of the Library\r\nwith which the Combined Work was made is also called the \"Linked\r\nVersion\".\r\n\r\nThe \"Minimal Corresponding Source\" for a Combined Work means the\r\nCorresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code\r\nfor portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are\r\nbased on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.\r\n\r\nThe \"Corresponding Application Code\" for a Combined Work means the\r\nobject code and\/or source code for the Application, including any data\r\nand utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the\r\nApplication, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.\r\n\r\n1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.\r\n\r\nYou may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License\r\nwithout being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.\r\n\r\n2. Conveying Modified Versions.\r\n\r\nIf you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a\r\nfacility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application\r\nthat uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the\r\nfacility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified\r\nversion:\r\n\r\na) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to\r\nensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the\r\nfunction or data, the facility still operates, and performs\r\nwhatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or\r\n\r\nb) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of\r\nthis License applicable to that copy.\r\n\r\n3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.\r\n\r\nThe object code form of an Application may incorporate material from\r\na header file that is part of the Library. You may convey such object\r\ncode under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated\r\nmaterial is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure\r\nlayouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates\r\n(ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:\r\n\r\na) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the\r\nLibrary is used in it and that the Library and its use are\r\ncovered by this License.\r\n\r\nb) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license\r\ndocument.\r\n\r\n4. Combined Works.\r\n\r\nYou may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that,\r\ntaken together, effectively do not restrict modification of the\r\nportions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse\r\nengineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of\r\nthe following:\r\n\r\na) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that\r\nthe Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are\r\ncovered by this License.\r\n\r\nb) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license\r\ndocument.\r\n\r\nc) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during\r\nexecution, include the copyright notice for the Library among\r\nthese notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the\r\ncopies of the GNU GPL and this license document.\r\n\r\nd) Do one of the following:\r\n\r\n0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this\r\nLicense, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form\r\nsuitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to\r\nrecombine or relink the Application with a modified version of\r\nthe Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the\r\nmanner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying\r\nCorresponding Source.\r\n\r\n1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the\r\nLibrary. A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time\r\na copy of the Library already present on the user's computer\r\nsystem, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version\r\nof the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked\r\nVersion.\r\n\r\ne) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise\r\nbe required to provide such information under section 6 of the\r\nGNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is\r\nnecessary to install and execute a modified version of the\r\nCombined Work produced by recombining or relinking the\r\nApplication with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If\r\nyou use option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany\r\nthe Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application\r\nCode. If you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation\r\nInformation in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL\r\nfor conveying Corresponding Source.)\r\n\r\n5. Combined Libraries.\r\n\r\nYou may place library facilities that are a work based on the\r\nLibrary side by side in a single library together with other library\r\nfacilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this\r\nLicense, and convey such a combined library under terms of your\r\nchoice, if you do both of the following:\r\n\r\na) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based\r\non the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities,\r\nconveyed under the terms of this License.\r\n\r\nb) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it\r\nis a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the\r\naccompanying uncombined form of the same work.\r\n\r\n6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.\r\n\r\nThe Free Software Foundation may publish revised and\/or new versions\r\nof the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new\r\nversions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may\r\ndiffer in detail to address new problems or concerns.\r\n\r\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number. If the\r\nLibrary as you received it specifies that a certain numbered version\r\nof the GNU Lesser General Public License \"or any later version\"\r\napplies to it, you have the option of following the terms and\r\nconditions either of that published version or of any later version\r\npublished by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you\r\nreceived it does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser\r\nGeneral Public License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser\r\nGeneral Public License ever published by the Free Software Foundation.\r\n\r\nIf the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide\r\nwhether future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall\r\napply, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of any version is\r\npermanent authorization for you to choose that version for the\r\nLibrary.

Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted by a Contributor:\r\n\r\n(a) for any code that a Contributor has removed from Covered Software; or\r\n\r\n(b) for infringements caused by: (i) Your and any other third party's modifications of Covered Software, or (ii) the combination of its Contributions with other software (except as part of its Contributor Version); or\r\n\r\n(c) under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of its Contributions.\r\n\r\nThis License does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service marks, or logos of any Contributor (except as may be necessary to comply with the notice requirements in Section 3.4).\r\n\r\n2.4. Subsequent Licenses\r\nNo Contributor makes additional grants as a result of Your choice to distribute the Covered Software under a subsequent version of this License (see Section 10.2) or under the terms of a Secondary License (if permitted under the terms of Section 3.3).\r\n\r\n2.5. Representation\r\nEach Contributor represents that the Contributor believes its Contributions are its original creation(s) or it has sufficient rights to grant the rights to its Contributions conveyed by this License.\r\n\r\n2.6. Fair Use\r\nThis License is not intended to limit any rights You have under applicable copyright doctrines of fair use, fair dealing, or other equivalents.\r\n\r\n2.7. Conditions\r\nSections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 are conditions of the licenses granted in Section 2.1.\r\n\r\n3. Responsibilities\r\n\r\n3.1. Distribution of Source Form\r\nAll distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under the terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source Code Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this License, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not attempt to alter or restrict the recipients' rights in the Source Code Form.\r\n\r\n3.2. Distribution of Executable Form\r\nIf You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:\r\n\r\n(a) such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code Form, as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code Form by reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more than the cost of distribution to the recipient; and\r\n\r\n(b) You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients' rights in the Source Code Form under this License.\r\n\r\n3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work\r\nYou may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice, provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for the Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered Software with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the Covered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this License permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software under the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of the Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered Software under the terms of either this License or such Secondary License(s).\r\n\r\n3.4. Notices\r\nYou may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices (including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty, or limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of the Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to the extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.\r\n\r\n3.5. Application of Additional Terms\r\nYou may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any such warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any jurisdiction.\r\n\r\n4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation\r\nIf it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must be placed in a text file included with all distributions of the Covered Software under this License. Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.\r\n\r\n5. Termination\r\n\r\n5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically if You fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become compliant, then the rights granted under this License from a particular Contributor are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such Contributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an ongoing basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have come back into compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular Contributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor notifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the first time You have received notice of non-compliance with this License from such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after Your receipt of the notice.\r\n\r\n5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions, counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to You by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section 2.1 of this License shall terminate.\r\n\r\n5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License prior to termination shall survive termination.\r\n\r\n6. Disclaimer of Warranty\r\nCovered Software is provided under this License on an \"as is\" basis, without warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or statutory, including, without limitation, warranties that the Covered Software is free of defects, merchantable, fit for a particular purpose or non-infringing. The entire risk as to the quality and performance of the Covered Software is with You. Should any Covered Software prove defective in any respect, You (not any Contributor) assume the cost of any necessary servicing, repair, or correction. This disclaimer of warranty constitutes an essential part of this License. No use of any Covered Software is authorized under this License except under this disclaimer.\r\n\r\n7. Limitation of Liability\r\nUnder no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall any Contributor, or anyone who distributes Covered Software as permitted above, be liable to You for any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character including, without limitation, damages for lost profits, loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses, even if such party shall have been informed of the possibility of such damages. This limitation of liability shall not apply to liability for death or personal injury resulting from such party's negligence to the extent applicable law prohibits such limitation. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so this exclusion and limitation may not apply to You.\r\n\r\n8. Litigation\r\nAny litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the courts of a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal place of business and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that jurisdiction, without reference to its conflict-of-law provisions. Nothing in this Section shall prevent a party's ability to bring cross-claims or counter-claims.\r\n\r\n9. Miscellaneous\r\nThis License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not be used to construe this License against a Contributor.\r\n\r\n10. Versions of the License\r\n\r\n10.1. New Versions\r\nMozilla Foundation is the license steward. Except as provided in Section 10.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to modify or publish new versions of this License. Each version will be given a distinguishing version number.\r\n\r\n10.2. Effect of New Versions\r\nYou may distribute the Covered Software under the terms of the version of the License under which You originally received the Covered Software, or under the terms of any subsequent version published by the license steward.\r\n\r\n10.3. Modified Versions\r\nIf you create software not governed by this License, and you want to create a new license for such software, you may create and use a modified version of this License if you rename the license and remove any references to the name of the license steward (except to note that such modified license differs from this License).\r\n\r\n10.4. Distributing Source Code Form that is Incompatible With Secondary Licenses\r\nIf You choose to distribute Source Code Form that is Incompatible With Secondary Licenses under the terms of this version of the License, the notice described in Exhibit B of this License must be attached.\r\n\r\nExhibit A - Source Code Form License Notice\r\n\r\nThis Source Code Form is subject to the terms of the Mozilla Public License, v. 2.0. If a copy of the MPL was not distributed with this file, You can obtain one at http:\/\/mozilla.org\/MPL\/2.0\/.\r\n\r\nIf it is not possible or desirable to put the notice in a particular file, then You may include the notice in a location (such as a LICENSE file in a relevant directory) where a recipient would be likely to look for such a notice.\r\n\r\nYou may add additional accurate notices of copyright ownership.\r\n\r\nExhibit B - \"Incompatible With Secondary Licenses\" Notice\r\n\r\nThis Source Code Form is \"Incompatible With Secondary Licenses\", as defined by the Mozilla Public License, v. 2.0.",

        "rf_text": "1. PREAMBLE \r\n\r\nThis license is for software that provides a 3D graphics application \r\nprogram interface (API).The license is intended to offer terms similar \r\nto some standard General Public Licenses designed to foster open \r\nstandards and unrestricted accessibility to source code. Some of these \r\nlicenses require that, as a condition of the license of the software, \r\nany derivative works (that is, new software which is a work containing \r\nthe original program or a portion of it) must be available for general \r\nuse, without restriction other than for a minor transfer fee, and that \r\nthe source code for such derivative works must likewise be made \r\navailable. The only restriction is that such derivative works must be \r\nsubject to the same General Public License terms as the original work. \r\n\r\nThis 3dfx GLIDE Source Code General Public License differs from the \r\nstandard licenses of this type in that it does not require the entire \r\nderivative work to be made available under the terms of this license \r\nnor is the recipient required to make available the source code for \r\nthe entire derivative work. Rather, the license is limited to only the \r\nidentifiable portion of the derivative work that is derived from the \r\nlicensed software. The precise terms and conditions for copying, \r\ndistribution and modification follow. \r\n\r\n\r\n2. DEFINITIONS \r\n\r\n2.1 This License applies to any program (or other \"work\") which \r\ncontains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be \r\ndistributed under the terms of this 3dfx GLIDE Source Code General \r\nPublic License. \r\n\r\n2.2 The term \"Program\" as used in this Agreement refers to 3DFX's \r\nGLIDE source code and object code and any Derivative Work. \r\n\r\n2.3 \"Derivative Work\" means, for the purpose of the License, that \r\nportion of any work that contains the Program or the identifiable \r\nportion of a work that is derived from the Program, either verbatim or \r\nwith modifications and\/or translated into another language, and that \r\nperforms 3D graphics API operations. It does not include any other \r\nportions of a work. \r\n\r\n2.4 \"Modifications of the Program\" means any work, which includes a \r\nDerivative Work, and includes the whole of such work. \r\n\r\n2.5 \"License\" means this 3dfx GLIDE Source Code General Public License. \r\n\r\n2.6 The \"Source Code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work \r\nfor making modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source \r\ncode means all the source code for all modules it contains, any \r\nassociated interface definition files, and the scripts used to control \r\ncompilation and installation of the executable work. \r\n\r\n2.7 \"3dfx\" means 3dfx Interactive, Inc. \r\n\r\n\r\n3. LICENSED ACTIVITIES \r\n\r\n3.1 COPYING - You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the \r\nProgram's Source Code as you receive it, in any medium, subject to the \r\nprovision of section 3.3 and provided also that: \r\n\r\n(a) you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy \r\nan appropriate copyright notice (3dfx Interactive, Inc. 1999), a notice \r\nthat recipients who wish to copy, distribute or modify the Program can \r\nonly do so subject to this License, and a disclaimer of warranty as \r\nset forth in section 5; \r\n\r\n(b) keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and \r\nto the absence of any warranty; and \r\n\r\n(c) do not make any use of the GLIDE trademark without the prior \r\nwritten permission of 3dfx, and \r\n\r\n(d) give all recipients of the Program a copy of this License \r\nalong with the Program or instructions on how to easily receive a copy \r\nof this License. \r\n\r\n\r\n3.2 MODIFICATION OF THE PROGRAM\/DERIVATIVE WORKS - You may modify your \r\ncopy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, and copy and \r\ndistribute such modifications subject to the provisions of section 3.3 \r\nand provided that you also meet all of the following conditions: \r\n\r\n(a) you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy \r\nof a Derivative Work an appropriate copyright notice, a notice that \r\nrecipients who wish to copy, distribute or modify the Derivative Work \r\ncan only do so subject to this License, and a disclaimer of warranty \r\nas set forth in section 5; \r\n\r\n(b) keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and \r\nto the absence of any warranty; and \r\n\r\n(c) give all recipients of the Derivative Work a copy of this \r\nLicense along with the Derivative Work or instructions on how to easily \r\nreceive a copy of this License. \r\n\r\n(d) You must cause the modified files of the Derivative Work \r\nto carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the \r\ndate of any change. \r\n\r\n(e) You must cause any Derivative Work that you distribute or \r\npublish to be licensed at no charge to all third parties under the \r\nterms of this License. \r\n\r\n(f) You do not make any use of the GLIDE trademark without the \r\nprior written permission of 3dfx. \r\n\r\n(g) If the Derivative Work normally reads commands \r\ninteractively when run, you must cause it, when started running for \r\nsuch interactive use, to print or display an announcement as follows: \r\n\r\n\"COPYRIGHT 3DFX INTERACTIVE, INC. 1999, ALL RIGHTS RESERVED THIS \r\nSOFTWARE IS FREE AND PROVIDED \"AS IS,\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, \r\nEITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED. THERE IS NO RIGHT TO USE THE GLIDE \r\nTRADEMARK WITHOUT PRIOR WRITTEN PERMISSION OF 3DFX INTERACTIVE, \r\nINC. SEE THE 3DFX GLIDE GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE FOR A FULL TEXT OF THE \r\nDISTRIBUTION AND NON-WARRANTY PROVISIONS (REQUEST COPY FROM \r\nINFO@3DFX.COM).\" \r\n\r\n(h) The requirements of this section 3.2 do not apply to the \r\nmodified work as a whole but only to the Derivative Work. It is not \r\nthe intent of this License to claim rights or contest your rights to \r\nwork written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the \r\nright to control the distribution of Derivative Works. \r\n\r\n\r\n3.3 DISTRIBUTION \r\n\r\n(a) All copies of the Program or Derivative Works which are \r\ndistributed must include in the file headers the following language \r\nverbatim: \r\n\r\n\"THIS SOFTWARE IS SUBJECT TO COPYRIGHT PROTECTION AND IS OFFERED \r\nONLY PURSUANT TO THE 3DFX GLIDE GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE. THERE IS NO \r\nRIGHT TO USE THE GLIDE TRADEMARK WITHOUT PRIOR WRITTEN PERMISSION OF \r\n3DFX INTERACTIVE, INC. A COPY OF THIS LICENSE MAY BE OBTAINED FROM \r\nTHE DISTRIBUTOR OR BY CONTACTING 3DFX INTERACTIVE INC (info@3dfx.com). \r\nTHIS PROGRAM.

UNPUBLISHED RIGHTS RESERVED UNDER THE COPYRIGHT LAWS OF \r\nTHE UNITED STATES. \r\n\r\nCOPYRIGHT 3DFX INTERACTIVE, INC. 1999, ALL RIGHTS RESERVED\" \r\n\r\n(b) You may distribute the Program or a Derivative Work in \r\nobject code or executable form under the terms of Sections 3.1 and 3.2 \r\nprovided that you also do one of the following: \r\n\r\n(1) Accompany it with the complete corresponding \r\nmachine-readable source code, which must be distributed under the \r\nterms of Sections 3.1 and 3.2; or, \r\n\r\n(2) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at \r\nleast three years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than \r\nyour cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete \r\nmachine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be \r\ndistributed under the terms of Sections 3.1 and 3.2 on a medium \r\ncustomarily used for software interchange; or, \r\n\r\n(3) Accompany it with the information you received as \r\nto the offer to distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative \r\nis allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received \r\nthe program in object code or executable form with such an offer, in \r\naccord with Subsection 3.3(b)(2) above.) \r\n\r\n(c) The source code distributed need not include anything \r\nthat is normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with \r\nthe major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating \r\nsystem on which the executable runs, unless that component itself \r\naccompanies the executable code. \r\n\r\n(d) If distribution of executable code or object code is made \r\nby offering access to copy from a designated place, then offering \r\nequivalent access to copy the source code from the same place counts \r\nas distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not \r\ncompelled to copy the source along with the object code. \r\n\r\n(e) Each time you redistribute the Program or any Derivative \r\nWork, the recipient automatically receives a license from 3dfx and \r\nsuccessor licensors to copy, distribute or modify the Program and \r\nDerivative Works subject to the terms and conditions of the License. \r\nYou may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' \r\nexercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for \r\nenforcing compliance by third parties to this License. \r\n\r\n(f) You may not make any use of the GLIDE trademark without \r\nthe prior written permission of 3dfx. \r\n\r\n(g) You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the \r\nProgram or any Derivative Works except as expressly provided under \r\nthis License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or \r\ndistribute the Program or any Derivative Works is void, and will \r\nautomatically terminate your rights under this License. However, \r\nparties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this \r\nLicense will not have their licenses terminated so long as such \r\nparties remain in full compliance. \r\n\r\n\r\n4. MISCELLANEOUS \r\n\r\n4.1 Acceptance of this License is voluntary. By using, modifying or \r\ndistributing the Program or any Derivative Work, you indicate your \r\nacceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions \r\nfor copying, distributing or modifying the Program or works based on \r\nit. Nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the \r\nProgram or Derivative Works and doing so without acceptance of this \r\nLicense is in violation of the U.S. and international copyright laws. \r\n\r\n4.2 If the distribution and\/or use of the Program or Derivative Works \r\nis restricted in certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted \r\ninterfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Program under \r\nthis License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation \r\nexcluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in \r\nor among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License \r\nincorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this License. \r\n\r\n4.3 This License is to be construed according to the laws of the \r\nState of California and you consent to personal jurisdiction in the \r\nState of California in the event it is necessary to enforce the \r\nprovisions of this License. \r\n\r\n\r\n5.

The following is intended to describe the essential\r\ndifferences between the Academic Free License (AFL) version 1.0 and\r\nother open source licenses:\r\n\r\nThe Academic Free License is similar to the BSD, MIT, UoI\/NCSA and\r\nApache licenses in many respects but it is intended to solve a few\r\nproblems with those licenses.\r\n  * The AFL is written so as to make it clear what software is being\r\n    licensed (by the inclusion of a statement following the copyright\r\n    notice in the software). This way, the license functions better\r\n    than a template license. The BSD, MIT and UoI\/NCSA licenses apply\r\n    to unidentified software.\r\n  * The AFL contains a complete copyright grant to the software. The\r\n    BSD and Apache licenses are vague and incomplete in that respect.\r\n  * The AFL contains a complete patent grant to the software. The BSD,\r\n    MIT, UoI\/NCSA and Apache licenses rely on an implied patent\r\n    license and contain no explicit patent grant.\r\n  * The AFL makes it clear that no trademark rights are granted to the\r\n    licensor's trademarks. The Apache license contains such a\r\n    provision, but the BSD, MIT and UoI\/NCSA licenses do not.\r\n  * The AFL includes the warranty by the licensor that it either owns\r\n    the copyright or that it is distributing the software under a\r\n    license. None of the other licenses contain that warranty. All\r\n    other warranties are disclaimed, as is the case for the other\r\n    licenses.\r\n  * The AFL is itself copyrighted (with the right granted to copy and\r\n    distribute without modification). This ensures that the owner of\r\n    the copyright to the license will control changes. The Apache\r\n    license contains a copyright notice, but the BSD, MIT and UoI\/NCSA\r\n    licenses do not.",

If You distribute copies of the Original Work or a Derivative Work, You must make a reasonable effort under the circumstances to obtain the express assent of recipients to the terms of this License. Nothing else but this License (or another written agreement between Licensor and You) grants You permission to create Derivative Works based upon the Original Work or to exercise any of the rights granted in Section 1 herein, and any attempt to do so except under the terms of this License (or another written agreement between Licensor and You) is expressly prohibited by U.S. copyright law, the equivalent laws of other countries, and by international treaty. Therefore, by exercising any of the rights granted to You in Section 1 herein, You indicate Your acceptance of this License and all of its terms and conditions.\r\n\r\n10) Termination for Patent Action. This License shall terminate automatically and You may no longer exercise any of the rights granted to You by this License as of the date You commence an action, including a cross-claim or counterclaim, for patent infringement (i) against Licensor with respect to a patent applicable to software or (ii) against any entity with respect to a patent applicable to the Original Work (but excluding combinations of the Original Work with other software or hardware).\r\n\r\n11) Jurisdiction, Venue and Governing Law. Any action or suit relating to this License may be brought only in the courts of a jurisdiction wherein the Licensor resides or in which Licensor conducts its primary business, and under the laws of that jurisdiction excluding its conflict-of-law provisions. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any use of the Original Work outside the scope of this License or after its termination shall be subject to the requirements and penalties of the U.S. Copyright Act, 17 U.S.C. 101 et seq., the equivalent laws of other countries, and international treaty. This section shall survive the termination of this License.\r\n\r\n12) Attorneys Fees. In any action to enforce the terms of this License or seeking damages relating thereto, the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover its costs and expenses, including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees and costs incurred in connection with such action, including any appeal of such action. This section shall survive the termination of this License.\r\n\r\n13) Miscellaneous. This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable.\r\n\r\n14) Definition of \"You\" in This License. \"You\" throughout this License, whether in upper or lower case, means an individual or a legal entity exercising rights under, and complying with all of the terms of, this License. For legal entities, \"You\" includes any entity that controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with you. For purposes of this definition, \"control\" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.\r\n\r\n15) Right to Use. You may use the Original Work in all ways not otherwise restricted or conditioned by this License or by law, and Licensor promises not to interfere with or be responsible for such uses by You.\r\n\r\nThis license is Copyright (C) 2003 Lawrence E.

Licensor reserves the right to satisfy this obligation by placing a machine-readable copy of the Source Code in an information repository reasonably calculated to permit inexpensive and convenient access by You for as long as Licensor continues to distribute the Original Work, and by publishing the address of that information repository in a notice immediately following the copyright notice that applies to the Original Work.\r\n\r\n4) Exclusions From License Grant. Neither the names of Licensor, nor the names of any contributors to the Original Work, nor any of their trademarks or service marks, may be used to endorse or promote products derived from this Original Work without express prior written permission of the Licensor. Nothing in this License shall be deemed to grant any rights to trademarks, copyrights, patents, trade secrets or any other intellectual property of Licensor except as expressly stated herein. No patent license is granted to make, use, sell or offer to sell embodiments of any patent claims other than the licensed claims defined in Section 2. No right is granted to the trademarks of Licensor even if such marks are included in the Original Work. Nothing in this License shall be interpreted to prohibit Licensor from licensing under different terms from this License any Original Work that Licensor otherwise would have a right to license.\r\n\r\n5) This section intentionally omitted.\r\n\r\n6) Attribution Rights. You must retain, in the Source Code of any Derivative Works that You create, all copyright, patent or trademark notices from the Source Code of the Original Work, as well as any notices of licensing and any descriptive text identified therein as an \"Attribution Notice.\" You must cause the Source Code for any Derivative Works that You create to carry a prominent Attribution Notice reasonably calculated to inform recipients that You have modified the Original Work.\r\n\r\n7) Warranty of Provenance and Disclaimer of Warranty. Licensor warrants that the copyright in and to the Original Work and the patent rights granted herein by Licensor are owned by the Licensor or are sublicensed to You under the terms of this License with the permission of the contributor(s) of those copyrights and patent rights. Except as expressly stated in the immediately proceeding sentence, the Original Work is provided under this License on an \"AS IS\" BASIS and WITHOUT WARRANTY, either express or implied, including, without limitation, the warranties of NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY OF THE ORIGINAL WORK IS WITH YOU. This DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY constitutes an essential part of this License. No license to Original Work is granted hereunder except under this disclaimer.\r\n\r\n8) Limitation of Liability. Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall the Licensor be liable to any person for any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this License or the use of the Original Work including, without limitation, damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses. This limitation of liability shall not apply to liability for death or personal injury resulting from Licensor's negligence to the extent applicable law prohibits such limitation. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so this exclusion and limitation may not apply to You.\r\n\r\n9) Acceptance and Termination. If You distribute copies of the Original Work or a Derivative Work, You must make a reasonable effort under the circumstances to obtain the express assent of recipients to the terms of this License. Nothing else but this License (or another written agreement between Licensor and You) grants You permission to create Derivative Works based upon the Original Work or to exercise any of the rights granted in Section 1 herein, and any attempt to do so except under the terms of this License (or another written agreement between Licensor and You) is expressly prohibited by U.S. copyright law, the equivalent laws of other countries, and by international treaty. Therefore, by exercising any of the rights granted to You in Section 1 herein, You indicate Your acceptance of this License and all of its terms and conditions.\r\n\r\n10) Termination for Patent Action. This License shall terminate automatically and You may no longer exercise any of the rights granted to You by this License as of the date You commence an action, including a cross-claim or counterclaim, against Licensor or any licensee alleging that the Original Work infringes a patent. This termination provision shall not apply for an action alleging patent infringement by combinations of the Original Work with other software or hardware.\r\n\r\n11) Jurisdiction, Venue and Governing Law. Any action or suit relating to this License may be brought only in the courts of a jurisdiction wherein the Licensor resides or in which Licensor conducts its primary business, and under the laws of that jurisdiction excluding its conflict-of-law provisions. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any use of the Original Work outside the scope of this License or after its termination shall be subject to the requirements and penalties of the U.S. Copyright Act, 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 101 et seq., the equivalent laws of other countries, and international treaty. This section shall survive the termination of this License.\r\n\r\n12) Attorneys Fees. In any action to enforce the terms of this License or seeking damages relating thereto, the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover its costs and expenses, including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees and costs incurred in connection with such action, including any appeal of such action. This section shall survive the termination of this License.\r\n\r\n13) Miscellaneous. This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable.\r\n\r\n14) Definition of \"You\" in This License. \"You\" throughout this License, whether in upper or lower case, means an individual or a legal entity exercising rights under, and complying with all of the terms of, this License. For legal entities, \"You\" includes any entity that controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with you. For purposes of this definition, \"control\" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.\r\n\r\n15) Right to Use. You may use the Original Work in all ways not otherwise restricted or conditioned by this License or by law, and Licensor promises not to interfere with or be responsible for such uses by You.\r\n\r\nThis license is Copyright (C) 2003-2004 Lawrence E.

Licensor grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, sublicensable license, for the duration of the copyright, to do the following:\r\n\r\na) to reproduce the Original Work in copies, either alone or as part of a collective work;\r\n\r\nb) to translate, adapt, alter, transform, modify, or arrange the Original Work, thereby creating derivative works (\"Derivative Works\") based upon the Original Work;\r\n\r\nc) to distribute or communicate copies of the Original Work and Derivative Works to the public, under any license of your choice that does not contradict the terms and conditions, including Licensor's reserved rights and remedies, in this Academic Free License;\r\n\r\nd) to perform the Original Work publicly; and\r\n\r\ne) to display the Original Work publicly.\r\n\r\n2) Grant of Patent License. Licensor grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, sublicensable license, under patent claims owned or controlled by the Licensor that are embodied in the Original Work as furnished by the Licensor, for the duration of the patents, to make, use, sell, offer for sale, have made, and import the Original Work and Derivative Works.\r\n\r\n3) Grant of Source Code License. The term \"Source Code\" means the preferred form of the Original Work for making modifications to it and all available documentation describing how to modify the Original Work. Licensor agrees to provide a machine-readable copy of the Source Code of the Original Work along with each copy of the Original Work that Licensor distributes. Licensor reserves the right to satisfy this obligation by placing a machine-readable copy of the Source Code in an information repository reasonably calculated to permit inexpensive and convenient access by You for as long as Licensor continues to distribute the Original Work.\r\n\r\n4) Exclusions From License Grant. Neither the names of Licensor, nor the names of any contributors to the Original Work, nor any of their trademarks or service marks, may be used to endorse or promote products derived from this Original Work without express prior permission of the Licensor.

No license is granted to the trademarks of Licensor even if such marks are included in the Original Work. Nothing in this License shall be interpreted to prohibit Licensor from licensing under terms different from this License any Original Work that Licensor otherwise would have a right to license.\r\n\r\n5) External Deployment. The term \"External Deployment\" means the use, distribution, or communication of the Original Work or Derivative Works in any way such that the Original Work or Derivative Works may be used by anyone other than You, whether those works are distributed or communicated to those persons or made available as an application intended for use over a network. As an express condition for the grants of license hereunder, You must treat any External Deployment by You of the Original Work or a Derivative Work as a distribution under section 1(c).\r\n\r\n6) Attribution Rights. You must retain, in the Source Code of any Derivative Works that You create, all copyright, patent, or trademark notices from the Source Code of the Original Work, as well as any notices of licensing and any descriptive text identified therein as an \"Attribution Notice.\" You must cause the Source Code for any Derivative Works that You create to carry a prominent Attribution Notice reasonably calculated to inform recipients that You have modified the Original Work.\r\n\r\n7) Warranty of Provenance and Disclaimer of Warranty. Licensor warrants that the copyright in and to the Original Work and the patent rights granted herein by Licensor are owned by the Licensor or are sublicensed to You under the terms of this License with the permission of the contributor(s) of those copyrights and patent rights. Except as expressly stated in the immediately preceding sentence, the Original Work is provided under this License on an \"AS IS\" BASIS and WITHOUT WARRANTY, either express or implied, including, without limitation, the warranties of non-infringement, merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY OF THE ORIGINAL WORK IS WITH YOU. This DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY constitutes an essential part of this License.

This limitation of liability shall not apply to the extent applicable law prohibits such limitation.\r\n\r\n9) Acceptance and Termination. If, at any time, You expressly assented to this License, that assent indicates your clear and irrevocable acceptance of this License and all of its terms and conditions. If You distribute or communicate copies of the Original Work or a Derivative Work, You must make a reasonable effort under the circumstances to obtain the express assent of recipients to the terms of this License. This License conditions your rights to undertake the activities listed in Section 1, including your right to create Derivative Works based upon the Original Work, and doing so without honoring these terms and conditions is prohibited by copyright law and international treaty. Nothing in this License is intended to affect copyright exceptions and limitations (including \"fair use\" or \"fair dealing\"). This License shall terminate immediately and You may no longer exercise any of the rights granted to You by this License upon your failure to honor the conditions in Section 1(c).\r\n\r\n10) Termination for Patent Action. This License shall terminate automatically and You may no longer exercise any of the rights granted to You by this License as of the date You commence an action, including a cross-claim or counterclaim, against Licensor or any licensee alleging that the Original Work infringes a patent. This termination provision shall not apply for an action alleging patent infringement by combinations of the Original Work with other software or hardware.\r\n\r\n11) Jurisdiction, Venue and Governing Law.

All rights reserved.\r\n\r\nNOTE: This License is not the same as any of the GNU Licenses published by the Free Software Foundation. Its terms are substantially different from those of the GNU Licenses. If you are familiar with the GNU Licenses, please read this license with extra care.\r\nAladdin Enterprises hereby grants to anyone the permission to apply this License to their own work, as long as the entire License (including the above notices and this paragraph) is copied with no changes, additions, or deletions except for changing the first paragraph of Section 0 to include a suitable description of the work to which the license is being applied and of the person or entity that holds the copyright in the work, and, if the License is being applied to a work created in a country other than the United States, replacing the first paragraph of Section 6 with an appropriate reference to the laws of the appropriate country.\r\n\r\nThis License is not an Open Source license: among other things, it places restrictions on distribution of the Program, specifically including sale of the Program. While Aladdin Enterprises respects and supports the philosophy of the Open Source Definition, and shares the desire of the GNU project to keep licensed software freely redistributable in both source and object form, we feel that Open Source licenses unfairly prevent developers of useful software from being compensated proportionately when others profit financially from their work. This License attempts to ensure that those who receive, redistribute, and contribute to the licensed Program according to the Open Source and Free Software philosophies have the right to do so, while retaining for the developer(s) of the Program the power to make those who use the Program to enhance the value of commercial products pay for the privilege of doing so.\r\n\r\n0. Subject Matter\r\n\r\nThis License applies to the computer programs known as \"AFPL Ghostscript\", \"AFPL Ghostscript PCL5e\", \"AFPL Ghostscript PCL5c\", and \"AFPL Ghostscript PXL\".  The \"Program\", below, refers to such program. The Program is a copyrighted work whose copyright is held by Artifex Software Inc., located in San Rafael California and artofcode LLC, located in Benicia, California (the \"Licensor\"). Please note that AFPL Ghostscript is neither the program known as \"GNU Ghostscript\" nor the version of Ghostscript available for commercial licensing from Artifex Software Inc.\r\nA \"work based on the Program\" means either the Program or any derivative work of the Program, as defined in the United States Copyright Act of 1976, such as a translation or a modification.\r\n\r\nBY MODIFYING OR DISTRIBUTING THE PROGRAM (OR ANY WORK BASED ON THE PROGRAM), YOU INDICATE YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF THIS LICENSE TO DO SO, AND ALL ITS TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTING OR MODIFYING THE PROGRAM OR WORKS BASED ON IT. NOTHING OTHER THAN THIS LICENSE GRANTS YOU PERMISSION TO MODIFY OR DISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM OR ITS DERIVATIVE WORKS. THESE ACTIONS ARE PROHIBITED BY LAW. IF YOU DO NOT ACCEPT THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS, DO NOT MODIFY OR DISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM.\r\n\r\n1. Licenses.\r\n\r\nLicensor hereby grants you the following rights, provided that you comply with all of the restrictions set forth in this License and provided, further, that you distribute an unmodified copy of this License with the Program:\r\n(a)\r\nYou may copy and distribute literal (i.e., verbatim) copies of the Program's source code as you receive it throughout the world, in any medium.\r\n(b)\r\nYou may modify the Program, create works based on the Program and distribute copies of such throughout the world, in any medium.\r\n2. Restrictions.\r\n\r\nThis license is subject to the following restrictions:\r\n(a)\r\nDistribution of the Program or any work based on the Program by a commercial organization to any third party is prohibited if any payment is made in connection with such distribution, whether directly (as in payment for a copy of the Program) or indirectly (as in payment for some service related to the Program, or payment for some product or service that includes a copy of the Program \"without charge\"; these are only examples, and not an exhaustive enumeration of prohibited activities). The following methods of distribution involving payment shall not in and of themselves be a violation of this restriction:\r\n(i)\r\nPosting the Program on a public access information storage and retrieval service for which a fee is received for retrieving information (such as an on-line service), provided that the fee is not content-dependent (i.e., the fee would be the same for retrieving the same volume of information consisting of random data) and that access to the service and to the Program is available independent of any other product or service. An example of a service that does not fall under this section is an on-line service that is operated by a company and that is only available to customers of that company. (This is not an exhaustive enumeration.)\r\n(ii)\r\nDistributing the Program on removable computer-readable media, provided that the files containing the Program are reproduced entirely and verbatim on such media, that all information on such media be redistributable for non-commercial purposes without charge, and that such media are distributed by themselves (except for accompanying documentation) independent of any other product or service. Examples of such media include CD-ROM, magnetic tape, and optical storage media. (This is not intended to be an exhaustive list.) An example of a distribution that does not fall under this section is a CD-ROM included in a book or magazine. (This is not an exhaustive enumeration.)\r\n(b)\r\nActivities other than copying, distribution and modification of the Program are not subject to this License and they are outside its scope. Functional use (running) of the Program is not restricted, and any output produced through the use of the Program is subject to this license only if its contents constitute a work based on the Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).\r\n(c)\r\nYou must meet all of the following conditions with respect to any work that you distribute or publish that in whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof (\"the Work\"):\r\n(i)\r\nIf you have modified the Program, you must cause the Work to carry prominent notices stating that you have modified the Program's files and the date of any change. In each source file that you have modified, you must include a prominent notice that you have modified the file, including your name, your e-mail address (if any), and the date and purpose of the change;\r\n(ii)\r\nYou must cause the Work to be licensed as a whole and at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this License;\r\n(iii)\r\nIf the Work normally reads commands interactively when run, you must cause it, at each time the Work commences operation, to print or display an announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a warranty). Such notice must also state that users may redistribute the Work only under the conditions of this License and tell the user how to view the copy of this License included with the Work. (Exceptions: if the Program is interactive but normally prints or displays such an announcement only at the request of a user, such as in an \"About box\", the Work is required to print or display the notice only under the same circumstances; if the Program itself is interactive but does not normally print such an announcement, the Work is not required to print an announcement.);\r\n(iv)\r\nYou must accompany the Work with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, delivered on a medium customarily used for software interchange. The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the executable code. If you distribute with the Work any component that is normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, you must also distribute the source code of that component if you have it and are allowed to do so;\r\n(v)\r\nIf you distribute any written or printed material at all with the Work, such material must include either a written copy of this License, or a prominent written indication that the Work is covered by this License and written instructions for printing and\/or displaying the copy of the License on the distribution medium;\r\n(vi)\r\nYou may not impose any further restrictions on the recipient's exercise of the rights granted herein.\r\nIf distribution of executable or object code is made by offering the equivalent ability to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent ability to copy the source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source code along with the object code.\r\n3. Reservation of Rights.\r\n\r\nNo rights are granted to the Program except as expressly set forth herein. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.\r\n4. Other Restrictions.\r\n\r\nIf the distribution and\/or use of the Program is restricted in certain countries for any reason, Licensor may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this License.\r\n5. Limitations.\r\n\r\nTHE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED TO YOU \"AS IS,\" WITHOUT WARRANTY. THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT OF THIRD PARTY RIGHTS. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\r\nIN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL LICENSOR, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND\/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\r\n\r\n6. General.\r\n\r\nThis License is governed by the laws of the State of California, U.S.A., excluding choice of law rules.\r\nIf any part of this License is found to be in conflict with the law, that part shall be interpreted in its broadest meaning consistent with the law, and no other parts of the License shall be affected.\r\n\r\nFor United States Government users, the Program is provided with RESTRICTED RIGHTS. If you are a unit or agency of the United States Government or are acquiring the Program for any such unit or agency, the following apply:\r\n\r\nIf the unit or agency is the Department of Defense (\"DOD\"), the Program and its documentation are classified as \"commercial computer software\" and \"commercial computer software documentation\" respectively and, pursuant to DFAR Section 227.7202, the Government is acquiring the Program and its documentation in accordance with the terms of this License. If the unit or agency is other than DOD, the Program and its documentation are classified as \"commercial computer software\" and \"commercial computer software documentation\" respectively and, pursuant to FAR Section 12.212, the Government is acquiring the Program and its documentation in accordance with the terms of this License.",

Definitions\r\n\r\nAccess control mechanism: a technological measure which, in the ordinary course of its operation, requires the application of information, or a process or a treatment, with the authority of the copyright owner or related rights owner, to gain access to the work.\r\n\r\nActs authorised by licensor: acts concerning granted rights (in particular, act of access, act of copy, act of modification, act of sharing).\r\n\r\nActs not authorised by licensor: acts concerning copyright or possible moral rights.\r\n\r\nAuthor\/s: the creator\/s of an original work or the creator\/s of a derivative work.\r\n\r\nBroadcasting: the use of any means of distribution over a distance, such as telegraph, telephone, radio, television and other comparable media, including communication to the public by satellite and cable retransmission.\r\n\r\nCopy control mechanism: a technological measure which, in the ordinary course of its operation, prevents, restricts, or otherwise limits the exercise of a right of the copyright owner or related rights owner.\r\n\r\nDerivative work: a work based upon the copyrightable work released under the terms and the conditions of this license.\r\n\r\nDistribution: the marketing, the placing in circulation or the making available to the public, by whatever means and for whatever purpose, of a work or of copies thereof.\r\n\r\nElaboration: all forms of modification, adaptation and transformation of a work.\r\n\r\nLending: the making available for use of originals, of copies or of carriers of copyright works, for a limited period of time and for purposes other than those referred to in the paragraph 16.\r\n\r\nLicensee: the person acquiring rights under the terms and the conditions of this license.\r\n\r\nLicensor: the person offering the work under the terms and the conditions of this license.\r\n\r\nMoral rights: the author's right, recognized in some countries, to claim authorship of the work and to object to any distortion, mutilation or other modification of, or other derogatory action in relation to, the said work, which would be prejudicial to his honor or reputation; other author's rights recognized as moral rights in some countries.\r\n\r\nOriginal work: a work not based upon another work.\r\n\r\nRelated rights: the rights that belong to the performers, the producers of phonograms and broadcasting organizations in relation to their performances, phonograms and broadcasts respectively.\r\n\r\nRental: the making available for use of originals, of copies or of carriers of copyright works, for a limited period of time and for direct or indirect economic or commercial advantage.\r\n\r\nReproduction: the multiplication of copies of a work by any means, such as copying by hand, printing, lithography, engraving, photography, phonography, cinematography and any other process of reproduction.\r\n\r\nTranscription: the use of means suitable for transforming an oral work into a written work or into a work reproduced by one of the methods referred to in the preceding paragraph.\r\n\r\nTranslation: the translation of the work into another language or dialect.\r\n\r\nWork: the copyrightable work released under the terms and the conditions of this license.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. License's area of applicability\r\n\r\nThis license concerns copyright and related rights: this license does not treat any other right.\r\n\r\nNothing in this license is intended to prevent or restrict the exercise of rights not treated in this license, such as rights concerning privacy, private property, sale and other personal or private rights.\r\n\r\nNothing in this license is intended to prevent or restrict the private use of any lawful technological measure.\r\n\r\nNothing in this license is intended to prevent or restrict any limitation on the exclusive rights of the copyright owner or related rights owner under copyright law or other applicable law.\r\n\r\nThis license is applicable to the works of the mind having a creative character and belonging to literature, music, figurative arts, architecture, theater or cinematography, whatever their mode or form of expression.\r\n\r\n\r\n3. Object\r\n\r\nIn particular, this license is applicable to:\r\n\r\na. literary, dramatic, scientific, didactic and religious works, whether in written or oral form;\r\n\r\nb. musical works and compositions, with or without words, dramatico-musical works and musical variations that themselves constitute original works;\r\n\r\nc. choreographic works and works of dumb show, the form of which is fixed in writing or otherwise;\r\n\r\nd. works of sculpture, painting, drawing, engraving and similar figurative arts, including scenic art;\r\n\r\ne. architectural plans and works;\r\n\r\nf. works of cinematographic art, whether silent or with sound;\r\n\r\ng. works of photographic art and works expressed with processes analogous to photography;\r\n\r\nh. industrial design works that have creative character or inherent artistic character;\r\n\r\ni. collective works formed by the assembling of works, or parts of works, and possessing the character of a self-contained creation resulting from selection and coordination with a specific literary, scientific, didactic, religious, political or artistic aim, such as encyclopedias, dictionaries, anthologies, magazines and newspapers;\r\n\r\nj. works of a creative character derived from any such work, such as translations into another language, transformations into any other literary or artistic form, modifications and additions constituting a substantial remodeling of the original work, adaptations, arrangements, abridgments and variations which do not constitute an original work.\r\n\r\n\r\n4. Grant of rights\r\n\r\nLicensor authorizes licensee to exercise the following rights:\r\na. right of reproduction;\r\nb. right of distribution;\r\nc. right of publishing (also in a collection);\r\nd. right of public performance or recitation;\r\ne. right of broadcasting;\r\nf. right of modification;\r\ng. right of elaboration;\r\nh. right of transcription;\r\ni. right of translation;\r\nj. right of lending;\r\nk. right of rental;\r\nl. right of commercial use.\r\n\r\n\r\n5. Related rights and sublicensing\r\n\r\nLicensor declares to be related rights owner and he authorizes licensee to exercise them.\r\n\r\nIf the work is not object of related rights, preceding paragraph must be considered as void and having no legal effect.\r\n\r\nLicensee may not sublicense the work.\r\n\r\n\r\n6. No DRM\r\n\r\nThis license is incompatible with any technology, device or component that, in the normal course of its operation, is designed to prevent or restrict acts which are authorised or not authorised by licensor: this incompatibility causes the inapplicability of the license to the work.\r\n\r\nIn particular:\r\na. it is not possible to release validly under this license works or derivative works whose access control mechanism and\/or copy control mechanism prevents or restricts quantitatively and\/or qualitatively access to, fruition, copy, modification and\/or sharing of them;\r\nb. in conformity with this license, it is not allowed to prevent or restrict quantitatively and\/or qualitatively access to, fruition, copy, modification, and\/or sharing of works or derivative works through an access control mechanism and\/or a copy control mechanism;\r\nc. in conformity with this license, it is not allowed to prevent or restrict the exercise of a granted right through any digital, analog or physical method.\r\n\r\n\r\n7. Copyleft clause\r\n\r\nDerivative works, performances of the work, phonograms in which the work is fixed, broadcastings of the work must be released with a license that provides:\r\na. the renunciation to exclusive exercise of rights referred to in the articles 4 and 5;\r\nb. the same type of clause described in article 6;\r\nc. the same type of clause described in this article.\r\n\r\n\r\n8. Resolutory clause\r\n\r\nAny breach of this license (in particular, the breach of the articles 6 and 7) will automatically void this license, without the necessity of any communication from licensor.\r\n\r\n\r\n9. DISCLAIMER\r\n\r\nTO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, LICENSOR OFFERS THE WORK \"AS IS\" AND ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES ARE DISCLAIMED. TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES HOWEVER CAUSED.\r\n\r\n\r\n10.

        "rf_text": "AFFERO GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\r\nVersion 1, March 2002\r\n\r\nCopyright \u00a9 2002 Affero Inc.\r\n510 Third Street - Suite 225, San Francisco, CA 94107, USA\r\n\r\nThis license is a modified version of the GNU General Public License copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc. made with their permission. Section 2(d) has been added to cover use of software over a computer network.\r\n\r\nEveryone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.\r\n\r\nPreamble\r\n\r\nThe licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the Affero General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users. This Public License applies to most of Affero's software and to any other program whose authors commit to using it. (Some other Affero software is covered by the GNU Library General Public License instead.) You can apply it to your programs, too.\r\n\r\nWhen we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. This General Public License is designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.\r\n\r\nTo protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.\r\n\r\nFor example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\r\n\r\nWe protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and\/or modify the software.\r\n\r\nAlso, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free software. If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original authors' reputations.\r\n\r\nFinally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents. We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.\r\n\r\nThe precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.\r\n\r\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\r\n\r\n0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms of this Affero General Public License. The \"Program\", below, refers to any such program or work, and a \"work based on the Program\" means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and\/or translated into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term \"modification\".) Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".\r\n\r\nActivities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Program (independent of having been made by running the Program). Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.\r\n\r\n1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License along with the Program.\r\n\r\nYou may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\r\n\r\n2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\r\n\r\n* a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\r\n\r\n* b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.\r\n\r\n* c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when run, you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this License. (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on the Program is not required to print an announcement.)\r\n\r\n* d) If the Program as you received it is intended to interact with users through a computer network and if, in the version you received, any user interacting with the Program was given the opportunity to request transmission to that user of the Program's complete source code, you must not remove that facility from your modified version of the Program or work based on the Program, and must offer an equivalent opportunity for all users interacting with your Program through a computer network to request immediate transmission by HTTP of the complete source code of your modified version or other derivative work.\r\n\r\nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\r\n\r\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on the Program.\r\n\r\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this License.\r\n\r\n3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:\r\n\r\n* a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\r\n\r\n* b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\r\n\r\n* c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the program in object code or executable form with such an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)\r\n\r\nThe source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the executable. However, as a special exception, the source code distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable.\r\n\r\nIf distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code.\r\n\r\n4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.\r\n\r\n5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Program or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Program or works based on it.\r\n\r\n6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License.\r\n\r\n7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.\r\n\r\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.\r\n\r\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software distribution system, which is implemented by public license practices. Many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to the author\/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.\r\n\r\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of the rest of this License.\r\n\r\n8. If the distribution and\/or use of the Program is restricted in certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Program under this License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this License.\r\n\r\n9. Affero Inc. may publish revised and\/or new versions of the Affero General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\r\n\r\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and \"any later version\", you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later version published by Affero, Inc. If the Program does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose any version ever published by Affero, Inc.\r\n\r\nYou may also choose to redistribute modified versions of this program under any version of the Free Software Foundation's GNU General Public License version 3 or higher, so long as that version of the GNU GPL includes terms and conditions substantially equivalent to those of this license.\r\n\r\n10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by Affero, Inc., write to us; we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.\r\n\r\nNO WARRANTY\r\n\r\n11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND\/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\r\n\r\n12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND\/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.",

By contrast,\r\nour General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to\r\nshare and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free\r\nsoftware for all its users.\r\n\r\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\r\nprice.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\r\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\r\nthem if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you\r\nwant it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new\r\nfree programs, and that you know you can do these things.\r\n\r\n  Developers that use our General Public Licenses protect your rights\r\nwith two steps: (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer\r\nyou this License which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute\r\nand\/or modify the software.\r\n\r\n  A secondary benefit of defending all users' freedom is that\r\nimprovements made in alternate versions of the program, if they\r\nreceive widespread use, become available for other developers to\r\nincorporate.  Many developers of free software are heartened and\r\nencouraged by the resulting cooperation.  However, in the case of\r\nsoftware used on network servers, this result may fail to come about.\r\nThe GNU General Public License permits making a modified version and\r\nletting the public access it on a server without ever releasing its\r\nsource code to the public.\r\n\r\n  The GNU Affero General Public License is designed specifically to\r\nensure that, in such cases, the modified source code becomes available\r\nto the community.  It requires the operator of a network server to\r\nprovide the source code of the modified version running there to the\r\nusers of that server.  Therefore, public use of a modified version, on\r\na publicly accessible server, gives the public access to the source\r\ncode of the modified version.\r\n\r\n  An older license, called the Affero General Public License and\r\npublished by Affero, was designed to accomplish similar goals.  This is\r\na different license, not a version of the Affero GPL, but Affero has\r\nreleased a new version of the Affero GPL which permits relicensing under\r\nthis license.\r\n\r\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\r\nmodification follow.\r\n\r\n                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS\r\n\r\n  0. Definitions.\r\n\r\n  \"This License\" refers to version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License.\r\n\r\n  \"Copyright\" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of\r\nworks, such as semiconductor masks.\r\n\r\n  \"The Program\" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this\r\nLicense.  Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".  \"Licensees\" and\r\n\"recipients\" may be individuals or organizations.\r\n\r\n  To \"modify\" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work\r\nin a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an\r\nexact copy.  The resulting work is called a \"modified version\" of the\r\nearlier work or a work \"based on\" the earlier work.\r\n\r\n  A \"covered work\" means either the unmodified Program or a work based\r\non the Program.\r\n\r\n  To \"propagate\" a work means to do anything with it that, without\r\npermission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for\r\ninfringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a\r\ncomputer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,\r\ndistribution (with or without modification), making available to the\r\npublic, and in some countries other activities as well.\r\n\r\n  To \"convey\" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other\r\nparties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through\r\na computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.\r\n\r\n  An interactive user interface displays \"Appropriate Legal Notices\"\r\nto the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible\r\nfeature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)\r\ntells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the\r\nextent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the\r\nwork under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If\r\nthe interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a\r\nmenu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.\r\n\r\n  1. Source Code.\r\n\r\n  The \"source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work\r\nfor making modifications to it.  \"Object code\" means any non-source\r\nform of a work.\r\n\r\n  A \"Standard Interface\" means an interface that either is an official\r\nstandard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of\r\ninterfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that\r\nis widely used among developers working in that language.\r\n\r\n  The \"System Libraries\" of an executable work include anything, other\r\nthan the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of\r\npackaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major\r\nComponent, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that\r\nMajor Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an\r\nimplementation is available to the public in source code form.  A\r\n\"Major Component\", in this context, means a major essential component\r\n(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system\r\n(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to\r\nproduce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.\r\n\r\n  The \"Corresponding Source\" for a work in object code form means all\r\nthe source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable\r\nwork) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to\r\ncontrol those activities.  However, it does not include the work's\r\nSystem Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free\r\nprograms which are used unmodified in performing those activities but\r\nwhich are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source\r\nincludes interface definition files associated with source files for\r\nthe work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically\r\nlinked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,\r\nsuch as by intimate data communication or control flow between those\r\nsubprograms and other parts of the work.\r\n\r\n  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users\r\ncan regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding\r\nSource.\r\n\r\n  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that\r\nsame work.\r\n\r\n  2. Basic Permissions.\r\n\r\n  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of\r\ncopyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated\r\nconditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited\r\npermission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a\r\ncovered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its\r\ncontent, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your\r\nrights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.\r\n\r\n  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not\r\nconvey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains\r\nin force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose\r\nof having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you\r\nwith facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with\r\nthe terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do\r\nnot control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works\r\nfor you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction\r\nand control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of\r\nyour copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.\r\n\r\n  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under\r\nthe conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10\r\nmakes it unnecessary.\r\n\r\n  3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.\r\n\r\n  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological\r\nmeasure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article\r\n11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or\r\nsimilar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such\r\nmeasures.\r\n\r\n  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid\r\ncircumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention\r\nis effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to\r\nthe covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or\r\nmodification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's\r\nusers, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of\r\ntechnological measures.\r\n\r\n  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.\r\n\r\n  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you\r\nreceive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and\r\nappropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;\r\nkeep intact all notices stating that this License and any\r\nnon-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;\r\nkeep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all\r\nrecipients a copy of this License along with the Program.\r\n\r\n  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,\r\nand you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.\r\n\r\n  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.\r\n\r\n  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to\r\nproduce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the\r\nterms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\r\n\r\n    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified\r\n    it, and giving a relevant date.\r\n\r\n    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is\r\n    released under this License and any conditions added under section\r\n    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to\r\n    \"keep intact all notices\".\r\n\r\n    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this\r\n    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This\r\n    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7\r\n    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,\r\n    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no\r\n    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not\r\n    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.\r\n\r\n    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display\r\n    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive\r\n    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your\r\n    work need not make them do so.\r\n\r\n  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent\r\nworks, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,\r\nand which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,\r\nin or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an\r\n\"aggregate\" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not\r\nused to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users\r\nbeyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work\r\nin an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other\r\nparts of the aggregate.\r\n\r\n  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.\r\n\r\n  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms\r\nof sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the\r\nmachine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,\r\nin one of these ways:\r\n\r\n    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\r\n    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the\r\n    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium\r\n    customarily used for software interchange.\r\n\r\n    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\r\n    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a\r\n    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as\r\n    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product\r\n    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a\r\n    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the\r\n    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical\r\n    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no\r\n    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this\r\n    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the\r\n    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.\r\n\r\n    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the\r\n    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This\r\n    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and\r\n    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord\r\n    with subsection 6b.\r\n\r\n    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated\r\n    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the\r\n    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no\r\n    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the\r\n    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to\r\n    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source\r\n    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)\r\n    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain\r\n    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the\r\n    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the\r\n    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is\r\n    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.\r\n\r\n    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided\r\n    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding\r\n    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no\r\n    charge under subsection 6d.\r\n\r\n  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded\r\nfrom the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be\r\nincluded in conveying the object code work.\r\n\r\n  A \"User Product\" is either (1) a \"consumer product\", which means any\r\ntangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,\r\nor household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation\r\ninto a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,\r\ndoubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular\r\nproduct received by a particular user, \"normally used\" refers to a\r\ntypical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status\r\nof the particular user or of the way in which the particular user\r\nactually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product\r\nis a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial\r\ncommercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent\r\nthe only significant mode of use of the product.\r\n\r\n  \"Installation Information\" for a User Product means any methods,\r\nprocedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install\r\nand execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from\r\na modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must\r\nsuffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object\r\ncode is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because\r\nmodification has been made.\r\n\r\n  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or\r\nspecifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as\r\npart of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the\r\nUser Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a\r\nfixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the\r\nCorresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied\r\nby the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply\r\nif neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install\r\nmodified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has\r\nbeen installed in ROM).\r\n\r\n  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a\r\nrequirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates\r\nfor a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for\r\nthe User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a\r\nnetwork may be denied when the modification itself materially and\r\nadversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and\r\nprotocols for communication across the network.\r\n\r\n  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,\r\nin accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly\r\ndocumented (and with an implementation available to the public in\r\nsource code form), and must require no special password or key for\r\nunpacking, reading or copying.\r\n\r\n  7. Additional Terms.\r\n\r\n  \"Additional permissions\" are terms that supplement the terms of this\r\nLicense by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.\r\nAdditional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall\r\nbe treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent\r\nthat they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions\r\napply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately\r\nunder those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by\r\nthis License without regard to the additional permissions.\r\n\r\n  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option\r\nremove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of\r\nit.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own\r\nremoval in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place\r\nadditional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,\r\nfor which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.\r\n\r\n  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you\r\nadd to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of\r\nthat material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:\r\n\r\n    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the\r\n    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or\r\n\r\n    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or\r\n    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal\r\n    Notices displayed by works containing it; or\r\n\r\n    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or\r\n    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in\r\n    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or\r\n\r\n    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or\r\n    authors of the material; or\r\n\r\n    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some\r\n    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or\r\n\r\n    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that\r\n    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of\r\n    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for\r\n    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on\r\n    those licensors and authors.\r\n\r\n  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered \"further\r\nrestrictions\" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you\r\nreceived it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is\r\ngoverned by this License along with a term that is a further\r\nrestriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains\r\na further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this\r\nLicense, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms\r\nof that license document, provided that the further restriction does\r\nnot survive such relicensing or conveying.\r\n\r\n  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you\r\nmust place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the\r\nadditional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating\r\nwhere to find the applicable terms.\r\n\r\n  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the\r\nform of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;\r\nthe above requirements apply either way.\r\n\r\n  8. Termination.\r\n\r\n  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly\r\nprovided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or\r\nmodify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under\r\nthis License (including any patent licenses granted under the third\r\nparagraph of section 11).\r\n\r\n  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your\r\nlicense from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)\r\nprovisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and\r\nfinally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright\r\nholder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means\r\nprior to 60 days after the cessation.\r\n\r\n  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is\r\nreinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the\r\nviolation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have\r\nreceived notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that\r\ncopyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after\r\nyour receipt of the notice.\r\n\r\n  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the\r\nlicenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under\r\nthis License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently\r\nreinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same\r\nmaterial under section 10.\r\n\r\n  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.\r\n\r\n  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or\r\nrun a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work\r\noccurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission\r\nto receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,\r\nnothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or\r\nmodify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do\r\nnot accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a\r\ncovered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.\r\n\r\n  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.\r\n\r\n  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically\r\nreceives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and\r\npropagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible\r\nfor enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.\r\n\r\n  An \"entity transaction\" is a transaction transferring control of an\r\norganization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an\r\norganization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered\r\nwork results from an entity transaction, each party to that\r\ntransaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever\r\nlicenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could\r\ngive under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the\r\nCorresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if\r\nthe predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.\r\n\r\n  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the\r\nrights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may\r\nnot impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of\r\nrights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation\r\n(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that\r\nany patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for\r\nsale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.\r\n\r\n  11. Patents.\r\n\r\n  A \"contributor\" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this\r\nLicense of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The\r\nwork thus licensed is called the contributor's \"contributor version\".\r\n\r\n  A contributor's \"essential patent claims\" are all patent claims\r\nowned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or\r\nhereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted\r\nby this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,\r\nbut do not include claims that would be infringed only as a\r\nconsequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For\r\npurposes of this definition, \"control\" includes the right to grant\r\npatent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of\r\nthis License.\r\n\r\n  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free\r\npatent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to\r\nmake, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and\r\npropagate the contents of its contributor version.\r\n\r\n  In the following three paragraphs, a \"patent license\" is any express\r\nagreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent\r\n(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to\r\nsue for patent infringement).  To \"grant\" such a patent license to a\r\nparty means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a\r\npatent against the party.\r\n\r\n  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,\r\nand the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone\r\nto copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a\r\npublicly available network server or other readily accessible means,\r\nthen you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so\r\navailable, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the\r\npatent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner\r\nconsistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent\r\nlicense to downstream recipients.  \"Knowingly relying\" means you have\r\nactual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the\r\ncovered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work\r\nin a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that\r\ncountry that you have reason to believe are valid.\r\n\r\n  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or\r\narrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a\r\ncovered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties\r\nreceiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify\r\nor convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license\r\nyou grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered\r\nwork and works based on it.\r\n\r\n  A patent license is \"discriminatory\" if it does not include within\r\nthe scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is\r\nconditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are\r\nspecifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered\r\nwork if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is\r\nin the business of distributing software, under which you make payment\r\nto the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying\r\nthe work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the\r\nparties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory\r\npatent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work\r\nconveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily\r\nfor and in connection with specific products or compilations that\r\ncontain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,\r\nor that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.\r\n\r\n  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting\r\nany implied license or other defenses to infringement that may\r\notherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.\r\n\r\n  12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.\r\n\r\n  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\r\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\r\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a\r\ncovered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\r\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may\r\nnot convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you\r\nto collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey\r\nthe Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this\r\nLicense would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.\r\n\r\n  13. Remote Network Interaction; Use with the GNU General Public License.\r\n\r\n  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, if you modify the\r\nProgram, your modified version must prominently offer all users\r\ninteracting with it remotely through a computer network (if your version\r\nsupports such interaction) an opportunity to receive the Corresponding\r\nSource of your version by providing access to the Corresponding Source\r\nfrom a network server at no charge, through some standard or customary\r\nmeans of facilitating copying of software.  This Corresponding Source\r\nshall include the Corresponding Source for any work covered by version 3\r\nof the GNU General Public License that is incorporated pursuant to the\r\nfollowing paragraph.\r\n\r\n  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have\r\npermission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed\r\nunder version 3 of the GNU General Public License into a single\r\ncombined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this\r\nLicense will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,\r\nbut the work with which it is combined will remain governed by version\r\n3 of the GNU General Public License.\r\n\r\n  14. Revised Versions of this License.\r\n\r\n  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and\/or new versions of\r\nthe GNU Affero General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions\r\nwill be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\r\naddress new problems or concerns.\r\n\r\n  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the\r\nProgram specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU Affero General\r\nPublic License \"or any later version\" applies to it, you have the\r\noption of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered\r\nversion or of any later version published by the Free Software\r\nFoundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the\r\nGNU Affero General Public License, you may choose any version ever published\r\nby the Free Software Foundation.\r\n\r\n  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future\r\nversions of the GNU Affero General Public License can be used, that proxy's\r\npublic statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you\r\nto choose that version for the Program.\r\n\r\n  Later license versions may give you additional or different\r\npermissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any\r\nauthor or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a\r\nlater version.\r\n\r\n  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.\r\n\r\n  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY\r\nAPPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT\r\nHOLDERS AND\/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY\r\nOF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,\r\nTHE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\r\nPURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM\r\nIS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF\r\nALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\r\n\r\n  16. Limitation of Liability.\r\n\r\n  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\r\nWILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND\/OR CONVEYS\r\nTHE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY\r\nGENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE\r\nUSE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF\r\nDATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD\r\nPARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),\r\nEVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF\r\nSUCH DAMAGES.\r\n\r\n  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.\r\n\r\n  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided\r\nabove cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,\r\nreviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates\r\nan absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the\r\nProgram, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a\r\ncopy of the Program in return for a fee.\r\n\r\n                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\r\n\r\n            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\r\n\r\n  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest\r\npossible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it\r\nfree software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\r\n\r\n  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest\r\nto attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\r\nstate the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least\r\nthe \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\r\n\r\n    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\r\n    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\r\n\r\n    This program is free software: you can redistribute it and\/or modify\r\n    it under the terms of the GNU Affero General Public License as published by\r\n    the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or\r\n    (at your option) any later version.\r\n\r\n    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\r\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\r\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the\r\n    GNU Affero General Public License for more details.\r\n\r\n    You should have received a copy of the GNU Affero General Public License\r\n    along with this program.  If not, see <http:\/\/www.gnu.org\/licenses\/>.\r\n\r\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\r\n\r\n  If your software can interact with users remotely through a computer\r\nnetwork, you should also make sure that it provides a way for users to\r\nget its source.  For example, if your program is a web application, its\r\ninterface could display a \"Source\" link that leads users to an archive\r\nof the code.  There are many ways you could offer source, and different\r\nsolutions will be better for different programs; see section 13 for the\r\nspecific requirements.\r\n\r\n  You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,\r\nif any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if necessary.\r\nFor more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU AGPL, see\r\n<http:\/\/www.gnu.org\/licenses\/>.",

As used in this License:\r\n\r\n1.1\t \"Applicable Patent Rights\" mean:  (a) in the case where Apple is the grantor of rights, (i) claims of patents that are now or hereafter acquired, owned by or assigned to Apple and (ii) that cover subject matter contained in the Original Code, but only to the extent necessary to use, reproduce and\/or distribute the Original Code without infringement; and (b) in the case where You are the grantor of rights, (i) claims of patents that are now or hereafter acquired, owned by or assigned to You and (ii) that cover subject matter in Your Modifications, taken alone or in combination with Original Code.\r\n\r\n1.2\t\"Contributor\" means any person or entity that creates or contributes to the creation of Modifications.\r\n\r\n1.3\t \"Covered Code\" means the Original Code, Modifications, the combination of Original Code and any Modifications, and\/or any respective portions thereof.\r\n\r\n1.4\t\"Externally Deploy\" means: (a) to sublicense, distribute or otherwise make Covered Code available, directly or indirectly, to anyone other than You; and\/or (b) to use Covered Code, alone or as part of a Larger Work, in any way to provide a service, including but not limited to delivery of content, through electronic communication with a client other than You.\r\n\r\n1.5\t\"Larger Work\" means a work which combines Covered Code or portions thereof with code not governed by the terms of this License.\r\n\r\n1.6\t\"Modifications\" mean any addition to, deletion from, and\/or change to, the substance and\/or structure of the Original Code, any previous Modifications, the combination of Original Code and any previous Modifications, and\/or any respective portions thereof.  When code is released as a series of files, a Modification is:  (a) any addition to or deletion from the contents of a file containing Covered Code; and\/or (b) any new file or other representation of computer program statements that contains any part of Covered Code. \r\n\r\n1.7\t\"Original Code\" means (a) the Source Code of a program or other work as originally made available by Apple under this License, including the Source Code of any updates or upgrades to such programs or works made available by Apple under this License, and that has been expressly identified by Apple as such in the header file(s) of such work; and (b) the object code compiled from such Source Code and originally made available by Apple under this License\r\n\r\n1.8\t\"Source Code\" means the human readable form of a program or other work that is suitable for making modifications to it, including all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition files, scripts used to control compilation and installation of an executable (object code).\r\n\r\n1.9\t\"You\" or \"Your\" means an individual or a legal entity exercising rights under this License.

Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, Apple hereby grants You, effective on the date You accept this License and download the Original Code, a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive license, to the extent of Apple's Applicable Patent Rights and copyrights covering the Original Code, to do the following:\r\n\r\n2.1\tUnmodified Code.  You may use, reproduce, display, perform, internally distribute within Your organization, and Externally Deploy verbatim, unmodified copies of the Original Code, for commercial or non-commercial purposes, provided that in each instance:\r\n\r\n(a)\tYou must retain and reproduce in all copies of Original Code the copyright and other proprietary notices and disclaimers of Apple as they appear in the Original Code, and keep intact all notices in the Original Code that refer to this License; and\r\n\r\n(b) \tYou must include a copy of this License with every copy of Source Code of Covered Code and documentation You distribute or Externally Deploy, and You may not offer or impose any terms on such Source Code that alter or restrict this License or the recipients' rights hereunder, except as permitted under Section 6.\r\n\r\n2.2\tModified Code.  You may modify Covered Code and use, reproduce, display, perform, internally distribute within Your organization, and Externally Deploy Your Modifications and Covered Code, for commercial or non-commercial purposes, provided that in each instance You also meet all of these conditions:\r\n\r\n(a)\tYou must satisfy all the conditions of Section 2.1 with respect to the Source Code of the Covered Code; \r\n\r\n(b)\tYou must duplicate, to the extent it does not already exist, the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source Code of all Your Modifications, and cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that You changed the files and the date of any change; and\r\n\r\n(c)\tIf You Externally Deploy Your Modifications, You must make Source Code of all Your Externally Deployed Modifications either available to those to whom You have Externally Deployed Your Modifications, or publicly available.  Source Code of Your Externally Deployed Modifications must be released under the terms set forth in this License, including the license grants set forth in Section 3 below, for as long as you Externally Deploy the Covered Code or twelve (12) months from the date of initial External Deployment, whichever is longer. You should preferably distribute the Source Code of Your Externally Deployed Modifications electronically (e.g. download from a web site).\r\n\r\n2.3\tDistribution of Executable Versions.  In addition, if You Externally Deploy Covered Code (Original Code and\/or Modifications) in object code, executable form only, You must include a prominent notice, in the code itself as well as in related documentation, stating that Source Code of the Covered Code is available under the terms of this License with information on how and where to obtain such Source Code.  \r\n\r\n2.4\tThird Party Rights.  You expressly acknowledge and agree that although Apple and each Contributor grants the licenses to their respective portions of the Covered Code set forth herein, no assurances are provided by Apple or any Contributor that the Covered Code does not infringe the patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity. Apple and each Contributor disclaim any liability to You for claims brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, You hereby assume sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party patent license is required to allow You to distribute the Covered Code, it is Your responsibility to acquire that license before distributing the Covered Code.\r\n\r\n3.\tYour Grants.  In consideration of, and as a condition to, the licenses granted to You under this License, You hereby grant to any person or entity receiving or distributing Covered Code under this License a non-exclusive, royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable license, under Your Applicable Patent Rights and other intellectual property rights (other than patent) owned or controlled by You, to use, reproduce, display, perform, modify, sublicense, distribute and Externally Deploy Your Modifications of the same scope and extent as Apple's licenses under Sections 2.1 and 2.2 above.  \r\n\r\n4.\tLarger Works.  You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other code not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger Work as a single product.  In each such instance, You must make sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code or any portion thereof. \r\n\r\n5.\tLimitations on Patent License.   Except as expressly stated in Section 2, no other patent rights, express or implied, are granted by Apple herein.  Modifications and\/or Larger Works may require additional patent licenses from Apple which Apple may grant in its sole discretion.  \r\n\r\n6.\tAdditional Terms.  You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations and\/or other rights consistent with the scope of the license granted herein (\"Additional Terms\") to one or more recipients of Covered Code. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf and as Your sole responsibility, and not on behalf of Apple or any Contributor. You must obtain the recipient's agreement that any such Additional Terms are offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify, defend and hold Apple and every Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by or claims asserted against Apple or such Contributor by reason of any such Additional Terms. \r\n\r\n7.\tVersions of the License.  Apple may publish revised and\/or new versions of this License from time to time.  Each version will be given a distinguishing version number.  Once Original Code has been published under a particular version of this License, You may continue to use it under the terms of that version. You may also choose to use such Original Code under the terms of any subsequent version of this License published by Apple.  No one other than Apple has the right to modify the terms applicable to Covered Code created under this License.  \r\n\r\n8.\tNO WARRANTY OR SUPPORT.  The Covered Code may contain in whole or in part pre-release, untested, or not fully tested works.  The Covered Code may contain errors that could cause failures or loss of data, and may be incomplete or contain inaccuracies.  You expressly acknowledge and agree that use of the Covered Code, or any portion thereof, is at Your sole and entire risk.  THE COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\" AND WITHOUT WARRANTY, UPGRADES OR SUPPORT OF ANY KIND AND APPLE AND APPLE'S LICENSOR(S) (COLLECTIVELY REFERRED TO AS \"APPLE\" FOR THE PURPOSES OF SECTIONS 8 AND 9) AND ALL CONTRIBUTORS EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES AND\/OR CONDITIONS, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES AND\/OR CONDITIONS OF MERCHANTABILITY, OF SATISFACTORY QUALITY, OF FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OF ACCURACY, OF QUIET ENJOYMENT, AND NONINFRINGEMENT OF THIRD PARTY RIGHTS.  APPLE AND EACH CONTRIBUTOR DOES NOT WARRANT AGAINST INTERFERENCE WITH YOUR ENJOYMENT OF THE COVERED CODE, THAT THE FUNCTIONS CONTAINED IN THE COVERED CODE WILL MEET YOUR REQUIREMENTS, THAT THE OPERATION OF THE COVERED CODE WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR-FREE, OR THAT DEFECTS IN THE COVERED CODE WILL BE CORRECTED.  NO ORAL OR WRITTEN INFORMATION OR ADVICE GIVEN BY APPLE, AN APPLE AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE OR ANY CONTRIBUTOR SHALL CREATE A WARRANTY.  You acknowledge that the Covered Code is not intended for use in the operation of nuclear facilities, aircraft navigation, communication systems, or air traffic control machines in which case the failure of the Covered Code could lead to death, personal injury, or severe physical or environmental damage.\r\n\r\n9.\tLIMITATION OF LIABILITY. TO THE EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL APPLE OR ANY CONTRIBUTOR BE LIABLE FOR ANY INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, INDIRECT OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS LICENSE OR YOUR USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE COVERED CODE, OR ANY PORTION THEREOF, WHETHER UNDER A THEORY OF CONTRACT, WARRANTY, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), PRODUCTS LIABILITY OR OTHERWISE, EVEN IF APPLE OR SUCH CONTRIBUTOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES AND NOTWITHSTANDING THE FAILURE OF ESSENTIAL PURPOSE OF ANY REMEDY. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE LIMITATION OF LIABILITY OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. In no event shall Apple's total liability to You for all damages (other than as may be required by applicable law) under this License exceed the amount of fifty dollars ($50.00).\r\n\r\n10.\tTrademarks.  This License does not grant any rights to use the trademarks or trade names  \"Apple\", \"Mac\", \"Mac OS\", \"QuickTime\", \"QuickTime Streaming Server\" or any other trademarks, service marks, logos or trade names belonging to Apple (collectively \"Apple Marks\") or to any trademark, service mark, logo or trade name belonging to any Contributor.  You agree not to use any Apple Marks in or as part of the name of products derived from the Original Code or to endorse or promote products derived from the Original Code other than as expressly permitted by and in strict compliance at all times with Apple's third party trademark usage guidelines which are posted at http:\/\/www.apple.com\/legal\/guidelinesfor3rdparties.html.  \r\n\r\n11.\tOwnership. Subject to the licenses granted under this License, each Contributor retains all rights, title and interest in and to any Modifications made by such Contributor.  Apple retains all rights, title and interest in and to the Original Code and any Modifications made by or on behalf of Apple (\"Apple Modifications\"), and such Apple Modifications will not be automatically subject to this License.  Apple may, at its sole discretion, choose to license such Apple Modifications under this License, or on different terms from those contained in this License or may choose not to license them at all.  \r\n\r\n12.\tTermination.  \r\n\r\n12.1\tTermination.  This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate:\r\n\r\n(a)\tautomatically without notice from Apple if You fail to comply with any term(s) of this License and fail to cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of such breach;\r\n(b)\timmediately in the event of the circumstances described in Section 13.5(b); or\r\n(c)\tautomatically without notice from Apple if You, at any time during the term of this License, commence an action for patent infringement against Apple; provided that Apple did not first commence an action for patent infringement against You in that instance.\r\n\r\n12.2\tEffect of Termination.  Upon termination, You agree to immediately stop any further use, reproduction, modification, sublicensing and distribution of the Covered Code.  All sublicenses to the Covered Code which have been properly granted prior to termination shall survive any termination of this License.  Provisions which, by their nature, should remain in effect beyond the termination of this License shall survive, including but not limited to Sections 3, 5, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12.2 and 13.  No party will be liable to any other for compensation, indemnity or damages of any sort solely as a result of terminating this License in accordance with its terms, and termination of this License will be without prejudice to any other right or remedy of any party.\r\n\r\n13. \tMiscellaneous.\r\n\r\n13.1\tGovernment End Users.   The Covered Code is a \"commercial item\" as defined in FAR 2.101.  Government software and technical data rights in the Covered Code include only those rights customarily provided to the public as defined in this License. This customary commercial license in technical data and software is provided in accordance with FAR 12.211 (Technical Data) and 12.212 (Computer Software) and, for Department of Defense purchases, DFAR 252.227-7015 (Technical Data -- Commercial Items) and 227.7202-3 (Rights in Commercial Computer Software or Computer Software Documentation).  Accordingly, all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Code with only those rights set forth herein.\r\n\r\n13.2\tRelationship of Parties.  This License will not be construed as creating an agency, partnership, joint venture or any other form of legal association between or among You, Apple or any Contributor, and You will not represent to the contrary, whether expressly, by implication, appearance or otherwise.\r\n\r\n13.3\tIndependent Development.   Nothing in this License will impair Apple's right to acquire, license, develop, have others develop for it, market and\/or distribute technology or products that perform the same or similar functions as, or otherwise compete with, Modifications, Larger Works, technology or products that You may develop, produce, market or distribute.\r\n\r\n13.4\tWaiver; Construction.  Failure by Apple or any Contributor to enforce any provision of this License will not be deemed a waiver of future enforcement of that or any other provision.  Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter will not apply to this License.\r\n\r\n13.5\tSeverability.  (a) If for any reason a court of competent jurisdiction finds any provision of this License, or portion thereof, to be unenforceable, that provision of the License will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible so as to effect the economic benefits and intent of the parties, and the remainder of this License will continue in full force and effect.  (b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if applicable law prohibits or restricts You from fully and\/or specifically complying with Sections 2 and\/or 3 or prevents the enforceability of either of those Sections, this License will immediately terminate and You must immediately discontinue any use of the Covered Code and destroy all copies of it that are in your possession or control.\r\n\r\n13.6\tDispute Resolution.  Any litigation or other dispute resolution between You and Apple relating to this License shall take place in the Northern District of California, and You and Apple hereby consent to the personal jurisdiction of, and venue in, the state and federal courts within that District with respect to this License. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded.\r\n\r\n13.7\tEntire Agreement; Governing Law.  This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof.  This License shall be governed by the laws of the United States and the State of California, except that body of California law concerning conflicts of law. \r\n\r\nWhere You are located in the province of Quebec, Canada, the following clause applies:  The parties hereby confirm that they have requested that this License and all related documents be drafted in English.  Les parties ont exig\u00e9 que le pr\u00e9sent contrat et tous les documents connexes soient r\u00e9dig\u00e9s en anglais.\r\n\r\nEXHIBIT A. \r\n\r\n\"Portions Copyright (c) 1999-2007 Apple Inc.

No Warranty\r\nAptana represents that to its knowledge as of the date of first publication of the Program under this License, it has sufficient copyright rights in the Program, to grant the copyright license set forth in this License.\r\nEXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS SECTION 4, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using and reproducing the Program and assume any and all risks associated with its exercise of rights under this License, including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.\r\nWithout limiting the foregoing, Aptana provides no assurances that the Program does not infringe the patent or other intellectual property rights of any third party. Aptana disclaims any liability for claims based on infringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise.

If all Your rights under this License terminate, You agree to cease use of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable. However, Your obligations under this License, and this Section 6, shall continue and survive.\r\nThis Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of California and the intellectual property laws of the United States of America, without reference to conflicts of laws principles that would require the application of the laws of any other jurisdiction.

No party to this License will bring a legal action under this License more than one year after the cause of action arose. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not apply to this License.

No.168, Yung Chi Rd., Taipei, 110 Taiwan\r\nAll rights reserved except as specified below.\r\n\r\nEveryone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is forbidden.\r\n\r\nPreamble\r\n\r\n   The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the ARPHIC PUBLIC LICENSE specifically permits and encourages you to use this software, provided that you give the recipients all the rights that we gave you and make sure they can get the modifications of this software.\r\n\r\nLegal Terms\r\n\r\n0. Definitions:\r\n   Throughout this License, \"Font\" means the TrueType fonts \"AR PL Mingti2L Big5\", \"AR PL KaitiM Big5\" (BIG-5 character set) and \"AR PL SungtiL GB\", \"AR PL KaitiM GB\" (GB character set) which are originally distributed by Arphic, and the derivatives of those fonts created through any modification including modifying glyph, reordering glyph, converting format, changing font name, or adding\/deleting some characters in\/from glyph table.\r\n\r\n   \"PL\" means \"Public License\".\r\n\r\n   \"Copyright Holder\" means whoever is named in the copyright or copyrights for the Font.\r\n\r\n   \"You\" means the licensee, or person copying, redistributing or modifying the Font.\r\n\r\n   \"Freely Available\" means that you have the freedom to copy or modify the Font as well as redistribute copies of the Font under the same conditions you received, not price. If you wish, you can charge for this service.\r\n\r\n1. Copying & Distribution\r\n   You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of this Font in any medium, without restriction, provided that you retain this license file (ARPHICPL.TXT) unaltered in all copies.\r\n\r\n2. Modification\r\n   You may otherwise modify your copy of this Font in any way, including modifying glyph, reordering glyph, converting format, changing font name, or adding\/deleting some characters in\/from glyph table, and copy and distribute such modifications under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that the following conditions are met:\r\n\r\n   a) You must insert a prominent notice in each modified file stating how and when you changed that file.\r\n\r\n   b) You must make such modifications Freely Available as a whole to all third parties under the terms of this License, such as by offering access to copy the modifications from a designated place, or distributing the modifications on a medium customarily used for software interchange.\r\n\r\n   c) If the modified fonts normally reads commands interactively when run, you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute the Font under these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this License.\r\n\r\n   These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Font, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate works. Therefore, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Font with the Font on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this License.\r\n\r\n3. Condition Subsequent\r\n   You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Font except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Font will automatically retroactively void your rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies or rights from you under this License will keep their licenses valid so long as such parties remain in full compliance.\r\n\r\n4. Acceptance\r\n   You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Font. These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by copying, modifying, sublicensing or distributing the Font, you indicate your acceptance of this License and all its terms and conditions.\r\n\r\n5. Automatic Receipt\r\n   Each time you redistribute the Font, the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Font subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License. \r\n\r\n6. Contradiction\r\n   If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Font at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Font by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Font.\r\n\r\n   If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances. \r\n\r\n7. NO WARRANTY\r\n   BECAUSE THE FONT IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE FONT, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE FONT \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE FONT IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE FONT PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\r\n\r\n8. DAMAGES WAIVER\r\n   UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING, IN NO EVENT WILL ANY COPYRIGHTT HOLDERS, OR OTHER PARTIES WHO MAY COPY, MODIFY OR REDISTRIBUTE THE FONT AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE FONT (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO PROCUREMENT OF SUBSTITUTE GOODS OR SERVICES; LOSS OF USE, DATA OR PROFITS; OR BUSINESS INTERRUPTION), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDERS OR OTHER PARTIES HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.",

(You will not be required to justify it to the Copyright Holder, but only to the computing community at large as a market that must bear the fee.)\r\n\"Freely Available\" means that no fee is charged for the item itself, though there may be fees involved in handling the item. It also means that recipients of the item may redistribute it under the same conditions they received it.\r\n1. You may make and give away verbatim copies of the source form of the Standard Version of this Package without restriction, provided that you duplicate all of the original copyright notices and associated disclaimers.\r\n\r\n2. You may apply bug fixes, portability fixes and other modifications derived from the Public Domain or from the Copyright Holder. A Package modified in such a way shall still be considered the Standard Version.\r\n\r\n3. You may otherwise modify your copy of this Package in any way, provided that you insert a prominent notice in each changed file stating how and when you changed that file, and provided that you do at least ONE of the following:\r\n\r\na) place your modifications in the Public Domain or otherwise make them Freely Available, such as by posting said modifications to Usenet or an equivalent medium, or placing the modifications on a major archive site such as ftp.uu.net, or by allowing the Copyright Holder to include your modifications in the Standard Version of the Package.\r\n\r\nb) use the modified Package only within your corporation or organization.\r\n\r\nc) rename any non-standard executables so the names do not conflict with standard executables, which must also be provided, and provide a separate manual page for each non-standard executable that clearly documents how it differs from the Standard Version.\r\n\r\nd) make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder.\r\n\r\n4. You may distribute the programs of this Package in object code or executable form, provided that you do at least ONE of the following:\r\n\r\na) distribute a Standard Version of the executables and library files, together with instructions (in the manual page or equivalent) on where to get the Standard Version.\r\n\r\nb) accompany the distribution with the machine-readable source of the Package with your modifications.\r\n\r\nc) accompany any non-standard executables with their corresponding Standard Version executables, giving the non-standard executables non-standard names, and clearly documenting the differences in manual pages (or equivalent), together with instructions on where to get the Standard Version.\r\n\r\nd) make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder.\r\n\r\n5. You may charge a reasonable copying fee for any distribution of this Package. You may charge any fee you choose for support of this Package. You may not charge a fee for this Package itself. However, you may distribute this Package in aggregate with other (possibly commercial) programs as part of a larger (possibly commercial) software distribution provided that you do not advertise this Package as a product of your own.\r\n\r\n6. The scripts and library files supplied as input to or produced as output from the programs of this Package do not automatically fall under the copyright of this Package, but belong to whomever generated them, and may be sold commercially, and may be aggregated with this Package.\r\n\r\n7. C or perl subroutines supplied by you and linked into this Package shall not be considered part of this Package.\r\n\r\n8.

The intent is that the Copyright Holder maintains some artistic control over the development of that Package while still keeping the Package available as open source and free software.\r\n\r\nYou are always permitted to make arrangements wholly outside of this license directly with the Copyright Holder of a given Package. If the terms of this license do not permit the full use that you propose to make of the Package, you should contact the Copyright Holder and seek a different licensing arrangement.\r\n\r\nDefinitions\r\n\"Copyright Holder\" means the individual(s) or organization(s) named in the copyright notice for the entire Package.\r\n\r\n\"Contributor\" means any party that has contributed code or other material to the Package, in accordance with the Copyright Holder's procedures.\r\n\r\n\"You\" and \"your\" means any person who would like to copy, distribute, or modify the Package.\r\n\r\n\"Package\" means the collection of files distributed by the Copyright Holder, and derivatives of that collection and\/or of those files. A given Package may consist of either the Standard Version, or a Modified Version.\r\n\r\n\"Distribute\" means providing a copy of the Package or making it accessible to anyone else, or in the case of a company or organization, to others outside of your company or organization.\r\n\r\n\"Distributor Fee\" means any fee that you charge for Distributing this Package or providing support for this Package to another party. It does not mean licensing fees.\r\n\r\n\"Standard Version\" refers to the Package if it has not been modified, or has been modified only in ways explicitly requested by the Copyright Holder.\r\n\r\n\"Modified Version\" means the Package, if it has been changed, and such changes were not explicitly requested by the Copyright Holder.\r\n\r\n\"Original License\" means this Artistic License as Distributed with the Standard Version of the Package, in its current version or as it may be modified by The Perl Foundation in the future.\r\n\r\n\"Source\" form means the source code, documentation source, and configuration files for the Package.\r\n\r\n\"Compiled\" form means the compiled bytecode, object code, binary, or any other form resulting from mechanical transformation or translation of the Source form.\r\n\r\nPermission for Use and Modification Without Distribution\r\n(1) You are permitted to use the Standard Version and create and use Modified Versions for any purpose without restriction, provided that you do not Distribute the Modified Version.\r\n\r\nPermissions for Redistribution of the Standard Version\r\n(2) You may Distribute verbatim copies of the Source form of the Standard Version of this Package in any medium without restriction, either gratis or for a Distributor Fee, provided that you duplicate all of the original copyright notices and associated disclaimers. At your discretion, such verbatim copies may or may not include a Compiled form of the Package.\r\n\r\n(3) You may apply any bug fixes, portability changes, and other modifications made available from the Copyright Holder. The resulting Package will still be considered the Standard Version, and as such will be subject to the Original License.\r\n\r\nDistribution of Modified Versions of the Package as Source\r\n(4) You may Distribute your Modified Version as Source (either gratis or for a Distributor Fee, and with or without a Compiled form of the Modified Version) provided that you clearly document how it differs from the Standard Version, including, but not limited to, documenting any non-standard features, executables, or modules, and provided that you do at least ONE of the following:\r\n\r\n(a) make the Modified Version available to the Copyright Holder of the Standard Version, under the Original License, so that the Copyright Holder may include your modifications in the Standard Version.\r\n(b) ensure that installation of your Modified Version does not prevent the user installing or running the Standard Version. In addition, the Modified Version must bear a name that is different from the name of the Standard Version.\r\n(c) allow anyone who receives a copy of the Modified Version to make the Source form of the Modified Version available to others under\r\n(i) the Original License or\r\n(ii) a license that permits the licensee to freely copy, modify and redistribute the Modified Version using the same licensing terms that apply to the copy that the licensee received, and requires that the Source form of the Modified Version, and of any works derived from it, be made freely available in that license fees are prohibited but Distributor Fees are allowed.\r\nDistribution of Compiled Forms of the Standard Version or Modified Versions without the Source\r\n(5) You may Distribute Compiled forms of the Standard Version without the Source, provided that you include complete instructions on how to get the Source of the Standard Version. Such instructions must be valid at the time of your distribution. If these instructions, at any time while you are carrying out such distribution, become invalid, you must provide new instructions on demand or cease further distribution. If you provide valid instructions or cease distribution within thirty days after you become aware that the instructions are invalid, then you do not forfeit any of your rights under this license.\r\n\r\n(6) You may Distribute a Modified Version in Compiled form without the Source, provided that you comply with Section 4 with respect to the Source of the Modified Version.\r\n\r\nAggregating or Linking the Package\r\n(7) You may aggregate the Package (either the Standard Version or Modified Version) with other packages and Distribute the resulting aggregation provided that you do not charge a licensing fee for the Package. Distributor Fees are permitted, and licensing fees for other components in the aggregation are permitted. The terms of this license apply to the use and Distribution of the Standard or Modified Versions as included in the aggregation.\r\n\r\n(8) You are permitted to link Modified and Standard Versions with other works, to embed the Package in a larger work of your own, or to build stand-alone binary or bytecode versions of applications that include the Package, and Distribute the result without restriction, provided the result does not expose a direct interface to the Package.\r\n\r\nItems That are Not Considered Part of a Modified Version\r\n(9) Works (including, but not limited to, modules and scripts) that merely extend or make use of the Package, do not, by themselves, cause the Package to be a Modified Version. In addition, such works are not considered parts of the Package itself, and are not subject to the terms of this license.\r\n\r\nGeneral Provisions\r\n(10) Any use, modification, and distribution of the Standard or Modified Versions is governed by this Artistic License. By using, modifying or distributing the Package, you accept this license. Do not use, modify, or distribute the Package, if you do not accept this license.\r\n\r\n(11) If your Modified Version has been derived from a Modified Version made by someone other than you, you are nevertheless required to ensure that your Modified Version complies with the requirements of this license.\r\n\r\n(12) This license does not grant you the right to use any trademark, service mark, tradename, or logo of the Copyright Holder.\r\n\r\n(13) This license includes the non-exclusive, worldwide, free-of-charge patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import and otherwise transfer the Package with respect to any patent claims licensable by the Copyright Holder that are necessarily infringed by the Package. If you institute patent litigation (including a cross-claim or counterclaim) against any party alleging that the Package constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then this Artistic License to you shall terminate on the date that such litigation is filed.\r\n\r\n(14) Disclaimer of Warranty: THE PACKAGE IS PROVIDED BY THE COPYRIGHT HOLDER AND CONTRIBUTORS \"AS IS' AND WITHOUT ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES. THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR NON-INFRINGEMENT ARE DISCLAIMED TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY YOUR LOCAL LAW. UNLESS REQUIRED BY LAW, NO COPYRIGHT HOLDER OR CONTRIBUTOR WILL BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OF THE PACKAGE, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE.",

You further agree not to use Font Software in connection with software and\/or hardware which creates any derivative works of such Font Software.

You agree to use trademarks associated with the Font Software according to accepted trademark practice, including identification of the trademark owner's name. Trademarks can only be used to identify printed output produced by the Font Software.

You may not rent, lease, sublicense, give, lend, or further distribute the Font Software, or any copy thereof, except as expressly provided herein. You may transfer all your rights to use the Font Software to another person or legal entity provided that (i) the transferee accepts and agrees to be bound by all the terms and conditions of this Agreement, and (ii) you destroy all copies of the Font Software, including all copies stored in the memory of a hardware device.

If the Font Software does not perform substantially in accordance with its documentation, the entire, exclusive, and cumulative liability and remedy shall be limited to the refund of the license fee you paid to Ascender to obtain delivery of the Font Software. ASCENDER DOES NOT WARRANT THE PERFORMANCE OR RESULTS YOU MAY OBTAIN BY USING THE FONT SOFTWARE. THE FOREGOING STATES THE SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDIES FOR ASCENDER'S BREACH OF WARRANTY. EXCEPT FOR THE FOREGOING LIMITED WARRANTY, Ascender MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, AS TO NONINFRINGEMENT OF THIRD PARTY RIGHTS, MERCHANTABILITY, OR FITNESS FOR ANY PARTICULAR PURPOSE. IN NO EVENT WILL ASCENDER BE LIABLE TO YOU OR ANYONE ELSE (I) FOR ANY CONSEQUENTIAL, INCIDENTAL OR SPECIAL DAMAGES, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION ANY LOST PROFITS, LOST DATA, LOST BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES, OR LOST SAVINGS, EVEN IF ASCENDER HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES, OR (II) FOR ANY CLAIM AGAINST YOU BY ANY THIRD PARTY SEEKING SUCH DAMAGES EVEN IF ASCENDER HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\r\n\r\nSome states or jurisdictions do not allow the exclusions of limitations of incidental, consequential or special damages, so the above exclusion may not apply to you. Also, some states or jurisdictions do not allow the exclusions of implied warranties or limitations on how long an implied warranty may last, so the above limitations may not apply to you. To the greatest extent permitted by law, any implied warranties not effectively excluded by the Agreement are limited to ninety (90) days. Some jurisdictions do not permit a limitation of implied warranties where the product results in physical injury or death so that such limitations may not apply to you. In those jurisdictions, you agree that Ascender's liability for such physical injury or death shall not exceed One Hundred Thousand Dollars (U.S. $100,000), provided that such jurisdictions permit a limitation of such liability. This warranty gives you specific legal rights. You may have other rights that vary from state to state or jurisdiction to jurisdiction. The Font Software is nonreturnable and nonrefundable.\r\n\r\n15. The Agreement will be governed by the laws of Illinois applicable to contracts wholly entered and performable within such state. All disputes related to the Agreement shall be heard in the Circuit Court of Cook County, Illinois, U.S.A. or the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, Chicago, Illinois U.S.A. Both you and Ascender agree to the personal jurisdiction and venue of these courts in any action related to the Agreement. The Agreement will not be governed by the United Nations Convention of Contracts for the International Sale of Goods, the application of which is expressly excluded. If any part of this Agreement is found void and unenforceable, it will not affect the validity of the balance of the Agreement, which shall remain valid and enforceable according to its terms.\r\n\r\n16. The Agreement shall automatically terminate upon failure by you (or any authorized person or member of your immediate household to whom you have given permission to Use the Font Software) to comply with its terms. The termination of the Agreement shall not preclude Ascender from suing you for damages of any breach of the Agreement. The Agreement may only be modified in writing signed by an authorized officer of Ascender. You agree that the Font Software will not be shipped, transferred or exported into any country or used in any manner prohibited by the United States Export Administration or any applicable export laws, restrictions or regulations.\r\n\r\n17.

License Grant\r\n\r\nNumber of Users: \r\nIn consideration for the license fee paid, Bitstream grants to you only, the Licensee, the non-exclusive, nontransferable right to use and display the Bitstream Product purchased through this service. If you are using this product for your work, this agreement applies to your employer. Bitstream software collections consisting of one or more fonts from the Bitstream Typeface Library may be used on up to five (5) CPUs at your site connected to any number of printers or other image producing devices (regardless of resolutions) at your own site.\r\n\r\nMultiple Workstations: \r\nIf you have paid for and executed the Bitstream Multi-Workstation License Agreement, then you may use the Bitstream Product on the number of CPUs stated in that agreement.\r\n\r\nThird Parties: \r\nYou may send a copy of any Bitstream font along with your documents to a commercial printer or other service bureau to enable the editing or printing of your document, provided that such party has informed you that it owns a valid license to use that particular font software. You may also \"embed\" PC TrueType format fonts within your documents for the viewing, editing, and printing of those documents.\r\n\r\nPortable Documents. \r\nYou may send along with your documents a Portable Font Resource (\"PFR\") created by Bitstream's TrueDoc(r), for the purpose of allowing any third party to view, edit, or print the document remotely but with the express understanding that such party may not use such PFR to edit or print any other document unless independently licensed to do so. You may also \"embed\" Bitstream typefaces within PostScript-Language files, .PDF files, and .EVY files for distribution, viewing, and imaging to other parties.\r\n\r\nNo Modifications. \r\nYou may not modify, adapt, translate, reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble, or create derivative works based on the Bitstream Product without Bitstream's prior written consent.\r\n\r\nRights Reservation. \r\nBitstream reserves all rights not specifically granted to Licensee.\r\n\r\n2. Copyright\r\nThe Bitstream Product and the accompanying materials are copyrighted and contain proprietary information and trade secrets of Bitstream. Unauthorized copying of the Bitstream product even if modified, merged, or included with other software, or of the written materials, is expressly forbidden. You may be held legally responsible for any infringement of Bitstream's intellectual property rights that is caused or encouraged by your failure to abide by the terms of this Agreement, unless you have a Multi-Workstation License Agreement. You may make one (1) copy of the Bitstream Product solely for backup purposes provided the copyright and trademark notices are reproduced in their entirety on the backup copy.\r\n\r\n3. Termination\r\nThis Agreement is effective until terminated. This Agreement will terminate automatically without notice from Bitstream if you fail to comply with any provision contained herein. Upon termination, you must destroy the written materials, the Bitstream Product, and all copies of them, in part and in whole, including modified copies, if any.\r\n\r\n4. Product Upgrade\r\nBitstream may, from time to time, update the Bitstream Product. Bitstream Product upgrade pricing may apply.\r\n\r\n5. Disclaimer and Limited Warranty\r\nBitstream warrants the Bitstream Product to be free from defects in materials and workmanship under normal use for a period of ninety (90) days from the date of delivery as shown on your invoice. Bitstream's entire liability and your exclusive remedy as to a defective product shall be, at Bitstream's option, either return of purchase price or replacement of any such product that is returned to Bitstream with a copy of the invoice. Bitstream shall have no responsibility to replace the product or refund the purchase price if failure results from accident, abuse or misapplication, or if any product is lost or damaged due to theft, fire, or negligence. Any replacement product will be warranted for the remainder of the original warranty period or thirty (30) days, whichever is longer. This warranty gives you specific legal rights. You may have other rights, which vary from state to state.\r\n\r\nEXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY PROVIDED ABOVE, THE BITSTREAM PRODUCT, IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\". BITSTREAM DOES NOT MAKE ANY WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.\r\n\r\nThe entire risk as to the quality and performance of the Bitstream Product rests upon you.

U.S. Government Restricted Rights\r\nThe software product referred to as the Bitstream Product and its related documentation are provided with RESTRICTED RIGHTS.

ANY USE OF THE WORK OTHER THAN AS AUTHORIZED UNDER THIS LICENSE IS PROHIBITED.\r\n\r\nBY EXERCISING ANY RIGHTS TO THE WORK PROVIDED HERE, YOU ACCEPT AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE. THE LICENSOR GRANTS YOU THE RIGHTS CONTAINED HERE IN CONSIDERATION OF YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF SUCH TERMS AND CONDITIONS.\r\n\r\n1. Definitions\r\n\r\n\"Collective Work\" means a work, such as a periodical issue, anthology or encyclopedia, in which the Work in its entirety in unmodified form, along with a number of other contributions, constituting separate and independent works in themselves, are assembled into a collective whole. A work that constitutes a Collective Work will not be considered a Derivative Work (as defined below) for the purposes of this License.\r\n\"Derivative Work\" means a work based upon the Work or upon the Work and other pre-existing works, such as a translation, musical arrangement, dramatization, fictionalization, motion picture version, sound recording, art reproduction, abridgment, condensation, or any other form in which the Work may be recast, transformed, or adapted, except that a work that constitutes a Collective Work will not be considered a Derivative Work for the purpose of this License.\r\n\"Licensor\" means the individual or entity that offers the Work under the terms of this License.\r\n\"Original Author\" means the individual or entity who created the Work.\r\n\"Work\" means the copyrightable work of authorship offered under the terms of this License.\r\n\"You\" means an individual or entity exercising rights under this License who has not previously violated the terms of this License with respect to the Work, or who has received express permission from the Licensor to exercise rights under this License despite a previous violation.\r\n2.

The above rights include the right to make such modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights in other media and formats. All rights not expressly granted by Licensor are hereby reserved.\r\n\r\n4. Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made subject to and limited by the following restrictions:\r\n\r\nYou may distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform the Work only under the terms of this License, and You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier for, this License with every copy or phonorecord of the Work You distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on the Work that alter or restrict the terms of this License or the recipients' exercise of the rights granted hereunder. You may not sublicense the Work. You must keep intact all notices that refer to this License and to the disclaimer of warranties. You may not distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform the Work with any technological measures that control access or use of the Work in a manner inconsistent with the terms of this License Agreement. The above applies to the Work as incorporated in a Collective Work, but this does not require the Collective Work apart from the Work itself to be made subject to the terms of this License. If You create a Collective Work, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Collective Work any reference to such Licensor or the Original Author, as requested. If You create a Derivative Work, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Derivative Work any reference to such Licensor or the Original Author, as requested.\r\nIf you distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform the Work or any Derivative Works or Collective Works, You must keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and give the Original Author credit reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing by conveying the name (or pseudonym if applicable) of the Original Author if supplied; the title of the Work if supplied; in the case of a Derivative Work, a credit identifying the use of the Work in the Derivative Work (e.g., \"French translation of the Work by Original Author,\" or \"Screenplay based on original Work by Original Author\"). Such credit may be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however, that in the case of a Derivative Work or Collective Work, at a minimum such credit will appear where any other comparable authorship credit appears and in a manner at least as prominent as such other comparable authorship credit.\r\n5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer\r\n\r\nBy offering the Work for public release under this License, Licensor represents and warrants that, to the best of Licensor's knowledge after reasonable inquiry:\r\nLicensor has secured all rights in the Work necessary to grant the license rights hereunder and to permit the lawful exercise of the rights granted hereunder without You having any obligation to pay any royalties, compulsory license fees, residuals or any other payments;\r\nThe Work does not infringe the copyright, trademark, publicity rights, common law rights or any other right of any third party or constitute defamation, invasion of privacy or other tortious injury to any third party.\r\nEXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY STATED IN THIS LICENSE OR OTHERWISE AGREED IN WRITING OR REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE WORK IS LICENSED ON AN \"AS IS\" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES REGARDING THE CONTENTS OR ACCURACY OF THE WORK.\r\n6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, AND EXCEPT FOR DAMAGES ARISING FROM LIABILITY TO A THIRD PARTY RESULTING FROM BREACH OF THE WARRANTIES IN SECTION 5, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\r\n\r\n7. Termination\r\n\r\nThis License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this License. Individuals or entities who have received Derivative Works or Collective Works from You under this License, however, will not have their licenses terminated provided such individuals or entities remain in full compliance with those licenses.

There are no understandings, agreements or representations with respect to the Work not specified here. Licensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions that may appear in any communication from You.

A copy of The Frameworx Open License is provided in a file named the_frameworx_license.txt and included herein, and may also be available for inspection at http:\/\/www.frameworx.com.4. Restrictions on Open Downstream Distributions. Each Downstream Distribution made by You, and by any party directly or indirectly obtaining rights to the Frameworx Code Base through You, shall be made subject to a license grant or agreement to the extent necessary so that each distributee under that Downstream Distribution will be subject to the same restrictions on re-distribution and use as are binding on You hereunder. You may satisfy this licensing requirement either by:\r\n\r\n(a)     requiring as a condition to any Downstream Distribution made by you, or by any direct or indirect distributee of Your Downstream Distribution (or any portion or element thereof), that each distributee under the relevant Downstream Distribution obtain a direct license (on the same terms and conditions as those in this License Agreement) from The Frameworx Company; or\r\n\r\n(b)     sub-licensing all (and not less than all) of Your rights and obligations hereunder to that distributee, including (without limitation) Your obligation to require distributees to be bound by license restrictions as contemplated by this Section 4 above.\r\n\r\nThe Frameworx Company hereby grants to you all rights to sub-license your rights hereunder as necessary to fully effect the intent and purpose of this Section 4 above, provided, however, that your rights and obligations hereunder shall be unaffected by any such sublicensing. In addition, The Frameworx Company expressly retains all rights to take all appropriate action (including legal action) against any such direct or indirect sub-licensee to ensure its full compliance with the intent and purposes of this License Agreement.\r\n\r\n5. Intellectual Property. Except as expressly provided herein, this License Agreement preserves and respects Your and The Frameworx Companys respective intellectual property rights, including, in the case of The Frameworx Company, its copyrights and patent rights relating to the Frameworx Code Base.6.

License Violation. The License, and all of your rights thereunder, shall be deemed automatically terminated and void as of any Downstream Distribution directly or indirectly made or facilitated by You that violates the provisions of this License Agreement, provided, however, that this License Agreement shall survive any such termination in order to remedy the effects of such violation. This License Agreement shall be binding on the legal successors and assigns of the parties hereto.\r\n\r\nYour agreement to the foregoing as of the date hereof has been evidenced by your acceptance of the relevant software distribution hereunder.\r\n\r\n(C) THE FRAMEWORX COMPANY 2003\r\n",

Contributor Grant.\r\n\r\n    Subject to third party intellectual property claims, each Contributor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive license\r\n\r\n        sep 0mm\r\n    (a)\r\n        under intellectual property rights (other than patent or trademark) Licensable by Contributor, to use, reproduce, modify, display, perform, sublicense and distribute the Modifications created by such Contributor (or portions thereof) either on an unmodified basis, with other Modifications, as Covered Code and\/or as part of a Larger Work; and\r\n    (b)\r\n        under patents now or hereafter owned or controlled by Contributor, to make, have made, use and sell (\"offer to sell and import\") the Contributor Version (or portions thereof), but solely to the extent that any such patent is reasonably necessary to enable You to utilize, alone or in combination with other software, the Contributor Version (or portions thereof).\r\n    (c)\r\n    (d)\r\n\r\n3  DISTRIBUTION OBLIGATIONS.\r\n\r\n    sep 0mm\r\n3.1. Application of License.\r\n\r\n    The Modifications which You create or to which You contribute are governed by the terms of this License, including without limitation Section 2.2. The Source Code version of Covered Code may be distributed only under the terms of this License or a future version of this License released under Section 6.1, and You must include a copy of this License with every copy of the Source Code You distribute. You may not offer or impose any terms on any Source Code version that alters or restricts the applicable version of this License or the recipients' rights hereunder. However, You may include an additional document offering the additional rights described in Section 3.5.\r\n3.2. Availability of Source Code.\r\n\r\n    Any Modification created by You will be provided to the Initial Developer in Source Code form and are subject to the terms of the License.\r\n3.3. Description of Modifications.\r\n\r\n    You must cause all Covered Code to which You contribute to contain a file documenting the changes You made to create that Covered Code and the date of any change. You must include a prominent statement that the Modification is derived, directly or indirectly, from Original Code provided by the Initial Developer and including the name of the Initial Developer in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in any notice in an Executable version or related documentation in which You describe the origin or ownership of the Covered Code.\r\n3.4. Intellectual Property Matters.\r\n\r\n        sep 0mm\r\n    (a) Third Party Claims.\r\n        If Contributor has knowledge that a license under a third party's intellectual property rights is required to exercise the rights granted by such Contributor under Sections 2.1 or 2.2, Contributor must include a text file with the Source Code distribution titled \"LEGAL\" which describes the claim and the party making the claim in sufficient detail that a recipient will know whom to contact. If Contributor obtains such knowledge after the Modification is made available as described in Section 3.2, Contributor shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies Contributor makes available thereafter and shall take other steps (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably calculated to inform those who received the Covered Code that new knowledge has been obtained.\r\n    (b) Contributor APIs.\r\n        If Contributor's Modifications include an application programming interface and Contributor has knowledge of patent licenses which are reasonably necessary to implement that API, Contributor must also include this information in the LEGAL file.\r\n    (c) Representations.\r\n        Contributor represents that, except as disclosed pursuant to Section 3.4(a) above, Contributor believes that Contributor's Modifications are Contributor's original creation(s) and\/or Contributor has sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by this License. \r\n\r\n3.5. Required Notices.\r\n\r\n    You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source Code. If it is not possible to put such notice in a particular Source Code file due to its structure, then You must include such notice in a location (such as a relevant directory) where a user would be likely to look for such a notice. If You created one or more Modification(s) You may add your name as a Contributor to the notice described in Exhibit A. You must also duplicate this License in any documentation for the Source Code where You describe recipients' rights or ownership rights relating to Covered Code. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Code. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any Contributor.\r\n3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions.\r\n\r\n    You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the requirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered Code. You may distribute the Executable version of Covered Code or ownership rights under a license of Your choice, which may contain terms different from this License, provided that You are in compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the Executable version does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient's rights in the Source Code version from the rights set forth in this License. If You distribute the Executable version under a different license You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ from this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer or any Contributor. If you distribute executable versions containing Covered Code as part of a product, you must reproduce the notice in Exhibit B in the documentation and\/or other materials provided with the product.\r\n3.7. Larger Works.\r\n\r\n    You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other code not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code.\r\n3.8. Restrictions.\r\n\r\n    You may not remove any product identification, copyright, proprietary notices or labels from gSOAP.\r\n\r\n4  INABILITY TO COMPLY DUE TO STATUTE OR REGULATION.\r\nIf it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License with respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must be included in the LEGAL file described in Section 3.4 and must be included with all distributions of the Source Code. Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.\r\n5  APPLICATION OF THIS LICENSE.\r\nThis License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has attached the notice in Exhibit A and to related Covered Code.\r\n6  VERSIONS OF THE LICENSE.\r\n\r\n    sep 0mm\r\n6.1. New Versions.\r\n\r\n    Grantor may publish revised and\/or new versions of the License from time to time. Each version will be given a distinguishing version number.\r\n6.2. Effect of New Versions.\r\n\r\n    Once Covered Code has been published under a particular version of the License, You may always continue to use it under the terms of that version. You may also choose to use such Covered Code under the terms of any subsequent version of the License.\r\n6.3. Derivative Works.\r\n\r\n    If You create or use a modified version of this License (which you may only do in order to apply it to code which is not already Covered Code governed by this License), You must (a) rename Your license so that the phrase \"gSOAP\" or any confusingly similar phrase do not appear in your license (except to note that your license differs from this License) and (b) otherwise make it clear that Your version of the license contains terms which differ from the gSOAP Public License. (Filling in the name of the Initial Developer, Original Code or Contributor in the notice described in Exhibit A shall not of themselves be deemed to be modifications of this License.)\r\n\r\n7  DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.\r\nCOVERED CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN \"AS IS\" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR STATUTORY, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, OF FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT OF THIRD PARTY INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS, AND ANY WARRANTY THAT MAY ARISE BY REASON OF TRADE USAGE, CUSTOM, OR COURSE OF DEALING.

ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.\r\n1. DEFINITIONS\r\n\r\n\"Contribution\" means:\r\n\r\n   1. in the case of International Business Machines Corporation (\"IBM\"), the Original Program, and\r\n   2. in the case of each Contributor,\r\n         1. changes to the Program, and\r\n         2. additions to the Program; \r\n      where such changes and\/or additions to the Program originate from and are distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution 'originates' from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor's behalf. Contributions do not include additions to the Program which: (i) are separate modules of software distributed in conjunction with the Program under their own license agreement, and (ii) are not derivative works of the Program. \r\n\r\n\"Contributor\" means IBM and any other entity that distributes the Program. \r\n\"Licensed Patents \" mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone or when combined with the Program.\r\n\r\n\"Original Program\" means the original version of the software accompanying this Agreement as released by IBM, including source code, object code and documentation, if any.\r\n\r\n\"Program\" means the Original Program and Contributions.\r\n\r\n\"Recipient\" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement, including all Contributors.\r\n2. GRANT OF RIGHTS\r\n\r\n   1. Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, and such derivative works, in source code and object code form.\r\n   2. Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in source code and object code form. This patent license shall apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is licensed hereunder.\r\n   3. Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity. Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party patent license is required to allow Recipient to distribute the Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license before distributing the Program.\r\n   4. Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright license set forth in this Agreement. \r\n\r\n3. REQUIREMENTS\r\nA Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form under its own license agreement, provided that:\r\n\r\n   1. it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and\r\n   2. its license agreement:\r\n         1. effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties and conditions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose;\r\n         2. effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits;\r\n         3. states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are offered by that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and\r\n\r\n   2.\r\n         4. states that source code for the Program is available from such Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily used for software exchange. \r\n\r\nWhen the Program is made available in source code form:\r\n\r\n   1. it must be made available under this Agreement; and\r\n   2. a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the Program. \r\n\r\nEach Contributor must include the following in a conspicuous location in the Program:\r\n\r\n    Copyright (C) 1996, 1999 International Business Machines Corporation and others. All Rights Reserved. \r\n\r\nIn addition, each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its Contribution, if any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent Recipients to identify the originator of the Contribution.\r\n4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION\r\n\r\nCommercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner which does not create potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering, such Contributor (\"Commercial Contributor\") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every other Contributor (\"Indemnified Contributor\") against any losses, damages and costs (collectively \"Losses\") arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program in a commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such claim at its own expense.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims against the other Contributors related to those performance claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay those damages.\r\n5. NO WARRANTY\r\nEXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN \"AS IS\" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement, including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.\r\n6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY\r\nEXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\r\n7. GENERAL\r\nIf any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.\r\n\r\nIf Recipient institutes patent litigation against a Contributor with respect to a patent applicable to software (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit), then any patent licenses granted by that Contributor to such Recipient under this Agreement shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed. In addition, if Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software or hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed. All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable. However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement and any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and survive.\r\n\r\nIBM may publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement from time to time. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing version number. The Program (including Contributions) may always be distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which it was received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is published, Contributor may elect to distribute the Program (including its Contributions) under the new version. No one other than IBM has the right to modify this Agreement. Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual property of any Contributor under this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved.\r\n\r\nThis Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and the intellectual property laws of the United States of America. No party to this Agreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement more than one year after the cause of action arose. Each party waives its rights to a jury trial in any resulting litigation.\r\n",

If Apple suspends\r\nYour rights to Affected Original Code, nothing in this License shall\r\nbe construed to restrict You, at Your option and subject to applicable\r\nlaw, from replacing the Affected Original Code with non-infringing\r\ncode or independently negotiating for necessary rights from such third\r\nparty.\r\n\r\n9.2 LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES SHALL APPLE BE\r\nLIABLE FOR ANY INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, INDIRECT OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES\r\nARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS LICENSE OR YOUR USE OR INABILITY TO\r\nUSE THE ORIGINAL CODE, OR ANY PORTION THEREOF, WHETHER UNDER A THEORY\r\nOF CONTRACT, WARRANTY, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), PRODUCTS LIABILITY\r\nOR OTHERWISE, EVEN IF APPLE HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF\r\nSUCH DAMAGES AND NOTWITHSTANDING THE FAILURE OF ESSENTIAL PURPOSE OF\r\nANY REMEDY.

THE\r\nACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS COMPUTER\r\nASSOCIATES TRUSTED OPEN SOURCE LICENSE (\"LICENSE\"). ANY USE,\r\nREPRODUCTION, MODIFICATION OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES\r\nTHE RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS LICENSE.\r\n\r\nLicense Background\r\n\r\nComputer Associates International, Inc. (CA) believes in open source. We\r\nbelieve that the open source development approach can take appropriate\r\nsoftware programs to unprecedented levels of quality, growth, and\r\ninnovation. To demonstrate our continuing commitment to open source, we\r\nare releasing the Program (as defined below) under this License.\r\n\r\nThis License is intended to permit contributors and recipients of the\r\nProgram to use the Program, including its source code, freely and\r\nwithout many of the concerns of some other open source licenses.\r\nAlthough we expect the underlying Program, and Contributions (as defined\r\nbelow) made to such Program, to remain open, this License is designed to\r\npermit you to maintain your own software programs free of this License\r\nunless you choose to do so. Thus, only your Contributions to the Program\r\nmust be distributed under the terms of this License.\r\n\r\nThe provisions that follow set forth the terms and conditions under\r\nwhich you may use the Program.\r\n\r\n1. DEFINITIONS\r\n\r\n1.1 Contribution means (a) in the case of CA, the Original Program; and\r\n(b) in the case of each Contributor (including CA), changes and\r\nadditions to the Program, where such changes and\/or additions to the\r\nProgram originate from and are distributed by that particular\r\nContributor to unaffiliated third parties. A Contribution originates\r\nfrom a Contributor if it was added to the Program by such Contributor\r\nitself or anyone acting on such Contributors behalf. Contributions do\r\nnot include additions to the Program which: (x) are separate modules of\r\nsoftware distributed in conjunction with the Program under their own\r\nlicense agreement, and (y) are not derivative works of the Program.\r\n\r\n1.2 Contributor means CA and any other person or entity that distributes\r\nthe Program.\r\n\r\n1.3 Contributor Version means as to a Contributor, that version of the\r\nProgram that includes the Contributors Contribution but not any\r\nContributions made to the Program thereafter.\r\n\r\n1.4 Larger Work means a work that combines the Program or portions\r\nthereof with code not governed by the terms of this License.\r\n\r\n1.5 Licensed Patents mean patents licensable by a Contributor that are\r\ninfringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone or when combined\r\nwith the Program.\r\n\r\n1.6 Original Program means the original version of the software to which\r\nthis License is attached and as released by CA, including source code,\r\nobject code and documentation, if any.\r\n\r\n1.7 Program means the Original Program and Contributions.\r\n\r\n1.8 Recipient means anyone who modifies, copies, uses or distributes the\r\nProgram.\r\n\r\n2. GRANT OF RIGHTS\r\n\r\n2.1 Subject to the terms of this License, each Contributor hereby grants\r\nRecipient an irrevocable, non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free license\r\nto reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly\r\nperform, distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such Contributor,\r\nif any, and such derivative works, in source code and object code form.\r\nFor the avoidance of doubt, the license provided in this Section 2.1\r\nshall not include a license to any Licensed Patents of a Contributor.\r\n\r\n2.2 Subject to the terms of this License, each Contributor hereby grants\r\nRecipient an irrevocable, non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free license\r\nto the Licensed Patents to the extent necessary to make, use, sell,\r\noffer to sell and import the Contribution of such Contributor, if any,\r\nin source code and object code form. The license granted in this Section\r\n2.2 shall apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program\r\nif, at the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such\r\naddition of the Contribution causes the Licensed Patents to be infringed\r\nby such combination. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no license is\r\ngranted under this Section 2.2: (a) for any code or works that do not\r\ninclude the Contributor Version, as it exists and is used in accordance\r\nwith the terms hereof; (b) for infringements caused by: (i) third party\r\nmodifications of the Contributor Version; or (ii) the combination of\r\nContributions made by each such Contributor with other software (except\r\nas part of the Contributor Version) or other devices; or (c) with\r\nrespect to Licensed Patents infringed by the Program in the absence of\r\nContributions made by that Contributor.\r\n\r\n2.3 Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the\r\nlicenses to its Contributions set forth herein, except as provided in\r\nSection 2.4, no assurances are provided by any Contributor that the\r\nProgram does not infringe the patent or other intellectual property\r\nrights of any other person or entity. Each Contributor disclaims any\r\nliability to Recipient for claims brought by any other person or entity\r\nbased on infringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a\r\ncondition to exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, each\r\nRecipient hereby assumes sole responsibility to secure any other\r\nintellectual property rights needed, if any.\r\n\r\n2.4 Each Contributor represents and warrants that it has all right,\r\ntitle and interest in the copyrights in its Contributions, and has the\r\nright to grant the copyright licenses set forth in this License.\r\n\r\n3. DISTRIBUTION REQUIREMENTS\r\n\r\n3.1 If the Program is distributed in object code form, then a prominent\r\nnotice must be included in the code itself as well as in any related\r\ndocumentation, stating that the source code for the Program is available\r\nfrom the Contributor with information on how and where to obtain the\r\nsource code. A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in\r\nobject code form under its own license agreement, provided that:\r\n\r\na. it complies with the terms and conditions of this License; and \r\nb. its license agreement: \r\n\ti. effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties and \r\n\tconditions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions of title\r\n\tand non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of \r\n\tmerchantability and fitness for a particular purpose, to the maximum extent\r\n\tpermitted by applicable law;\r\n\tii. effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for \r\n\tdamages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and consequential \r\n\tdamages, such as lost profits, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable\r\n\tlaw; \r\n\tiii. states that any provisions which are inconsistent with this License are\r\n\toffered by that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and \r\n\tiv. states that source code for the Program is available from such \r\n\tContributor at the cost of distribution, and informs licensees how to obtain\r\n\tit in a reasonable manner.\r\n\r\n3.2 When the Program is made available in source code form:\r\n\r\na. it must be made available under this License; and \r\nb. a copy of this License must be included with each copy of the Program.\r\n\r\n3.3 This License is intended to facilitate the commercial distribution\r\nof the Program by any Contributor. However, Contributors may only charge\r\nRecipients a one-time, upfront fee for the distribution of the Program.\r\nContributors may not charge Recipients any recurring charge, license\r\nfee, or any ongoing royalty for the Recipients exercise of its rights\r\nunder this License to the Program. Contributors shall make the source\r\ncode for the Contributor Version they distribute available at a cost, if\r\nany, equal to the cost to the Contributor to physically copy and\r\ndistribute the work. It is not the intent of this License to prohibit a\r\nContributor from charging fees for any service or maintenance that a\r\nContributor may charge to a Recipient, so long as such fees are not an\r\nattempt to circumvent the foregoing restrictions on charging royalties\r\nor other recurring fees for the Program itself.\r\n\r\n3.4 A Contributor may create a Larger Work by combining the Program with\r\nother software code not governed by the terms of this License, and\r\ndistribute the Larger Work as a single product. In such a case, the\r\nContributor must make sure that the requirements of this License are\r\nfulfilled for the Program. Any Contributor who includes the Program in a\r\ncommercial product offering, including as part of a Larger Work, may\r\nsubject itself, but not any other Contributor, to additional contractual\r\ncommitments, including, but not limited to, performance warranties and\r\nnon-infringement representations on suchContributors behalf. No\r\nContributor may create any additional liability for other Contributors.\r\nTherefore, if a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product\r\noffering, such Contributor (Commercial Contributor) hereby agrees to\r\ndefend and indemnify every other Contributor (Indemnified Contributor)\r\nwho made Contributions to the Program distributed by the Commercial\r\nContributor against any losses, damages and costs (collectively Losses)\r\narising from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third\r\nparty against the Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the\r\nacts or omissions, including any additional contractual commitments, of\r\nsuch Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the\r\nProgram. The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or\r\nLosses relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property\r\ninfringement.\r\n\r\n3.5 If Contributor has knowledge that a license under a third partys\r\nintellectual property rights is required to exercise the rights granted\r\nby such Contributor under Sections 2.1 or 2.2, Contributor must (a)\r\ninclude a text file with the Program source code distribution titled\r\n..\/IP_ISSUES, and (b) notify CA in writing at Computer Associates\r\nInternational, Inc., One Computer Associates Plaza, Islandia, New York\r\n11749, Attn: Open Source Group or by email at opensource@ca.com, both\r\ndescribing the claim and the party making the claim in sufficient detail\r\nthat a Recipient and CA will know whom to contact with regard to such\r\nmatter. If Contributor obtains such knowledge after the Contribution is\r\nmade available, Contributor shall also promptly modify the IP_ISSUES\r\nfile in all copies Contributor makes available thereafter and shall take\r\nother steps (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups)\r\nreasonably calculated to inform those who received the Program that such\r\nnew knowledge has been obtained.\r\n\r\n3.6 Recipient shall not remove, obscure, or modify any CA or other\r\nContributor copyright or patent proprietary notices appearing in the\r\nProgram, whether in the source code, object code or in any\r\ndocumentation. In addition to the obligations set forth in Section 4,\r\neach Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its\r\nContribution, if any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent\r\nRecipients to identify the originator of the Contribution.\r\n\r\n4. CONTRIBUTION RESTRICTIONS\r\n\r\n4.1 Each Contributor must cause the Program to which the Contributor\r\nprovides a Contribution to contain a file documenting the changes the\r\nContributor made to create its version of the Program and the date of\r\nany change. Each Contributor must also include a prominent statement\r\nthat the Contribution is derived, directly or indirectly, from the\r\nProgram distributed by a prior Contributor, including the name of the\r\nprior Contributor from which such Contribution was derived, in (a) the\r\nProgram source code, and (b) in any notice in an executable version or\r\nrelated documentation in which the Contributor describes the origin or\r\nownership of the Program.\r\n\r\n5.

DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY\r\n\r\n6.1 EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS LICENSE, AND TO THE EXTENT\r\nPERMITTED BY LAW, NO CONTRIBUTOR SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY\r\nDIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL\r\nDAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND\r\nON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR\r\nTORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE\r\nUSE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED\r\nHEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\r\n\r\n7.

However, Recipients\r\nobligations under this License and any licenses granted by Recipient as\r\na Contributor relating to the Program shall continue and survive\r\ntermination.\r\n\r\n11.

Distribution Obligations.\r\n\r\n            3.1. Availability of Source Code.\r\n\r\n            Any Covered Software that You distribute or otherwise make\r\n            available in Executable form must also be made available in\r\n            Source Code form and that Source Code form must be\r\n            distributed only under the terms of this License. You must\r\n            include a copy of this License with every copy of the\r\n            Source Code form of the Covered Software You distribute or\r\n            otherwise make available. You must inform recipients of any\r\n            such Covered Software in Executable form as to how they can\r\n            obtain such Covered Software in Source Code form in a\r\n            reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily used\r\n            for software exchange.\r\n\r\n            3.2. Modifications.\r\n\r\n            The Modifications that You create or to which You\r\n            contribute are governed by the terms of this License. You\r\n            represent that You believe Your Modifications are Your\r\n            original creation(s) and\/or You have sufficient rights to\r\n            grant the rights conveyed by this License.\r\n\r\n            3.3. Required Notices.\r\n\r\n            You must include a notice in each of Your Modifications\r\n            that identifies You as the Contributor of the Modification.\r\n            You may not remove or alter any copyright, patent or\r\n            trademark notices contained within the Covered Software, or\r\n            any notices of licensing or any descriptive text giving\r\n            attribution to any Contributor or the Initial Developer.\r\n\r\n            3.4. Application of Additional Terms.\r\n\r\n            You may not offer or impose any terms on any Covered\r\n            Software in Source Code form that alters or restricts the\r\n            applicable version of this License or the recipients'\r\n            rights hereunder. You may choose to offer, and to charge a\r\n            fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability\r\n            obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Software.\r\n            However, you may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on\r\n            behalf of the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You\r\n            must make it absolutely clear that any such warranty,\r\n            support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by\r\n            You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial\r\n            Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred\r\n            by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of\r\n            warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.\r\n          \r\n\r\n            3.5. Distribution of Executable Versions.\r\n\r\n            You may distribute the Executable form of the Covered\r\n            Software under the terms of this License or under the terms\r\n            of a license of Your choice, which may contain terms\r\n            different from this License, provided that You are in\r\n            compliance with the terms of this License and that the\r\n            license for the Executable form does not attempt to limit\r\n            or alter the recipient's rights in the Source Code form\r\n            from the rights set forth in this License. If You\r\n            distribute the Covered Software in Executable form under a\r\n            different license, You must make it absolutely clear that\r\n            any terms which differ from this License are offered by You\r\n            alone, not by the Initial Developer or Contributor. You\r\n            hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every\r\n            Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial\r\n            Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such terms\r\n            You offer.\r\n\r\n            3.6. Larger Works.\r\n\r\n            You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Software\r\n            with other code not governed by the terms of this License\r\n            and distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In such\r\n            a case, You must make sure the requirements of this License\r\n            are fulfilled for the Covered Software. \r\n            \r\n      4. Versions of the License. \r\n\r\n            4.1. New Versions.\r\n\r\n            Sun Microsystems, Inc. is the initial license steward and\r\n            may publish revised and\/or new versions of this License\r\n            from time to time. Each version will be given a\r\n            distinguishing version number. Except as provided in\r\n            Section 4.3, no one other than the license steward has the\r\n            right to modify this License. \r\n\r\n            4.2. Effect of New Versions.\r\n\r\n            You may always continue to use, distribute or otherwise\r\n            make the Covered Software available under the terms of the\r\n            version of the License under which You originally received\r\n            the Covered Software. If the Initial Developer includes a\r\n            notice in the Original Software prohibiting it from being\r\n            distributed or otherwise made available under any\r\n            subsequent version of the License, You must distribute and\r\n            make the Covered Software available under the terms of the\r\n            version of the License under which You originally received\r\n            the Covered Software. Otherwise, You may also choose to\r\n            use, distribute or otherwise make the Covered Software\r\n            available under the terms of any subsequent version of the\r\n            License published by the license steward. \r\n\r\n            4.3. Modified Versions.\r\n\r\n            When You are an Initial Developer and You want to create a\r\n            new license for Your Original Software, You may create and\r\n            use a modified version of this License if You: (a) rename\r\n            the license and remove any references to the name of the\r\n            license steward (except to note that the license differs\r\n            from this License); and (b) otherwise make it clear that\r\n            the license contains terms which differ from this License.\r\n            \r\n\r\n      5. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.\r\n\r\n      COVERED SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN AS IS\r\n      BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED,\r\n      INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED\r\n      SOFTWARE IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR\r\n      PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND\r\n      PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY\r\n      COVERED SOFTWARE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE\r\n      INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF\r\n      ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF\r\n      WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF\r\n      ANY COVERED SOFTWARE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS\r\n      DISCLAIMER. \r\n\r\n      6. TERMINATION. \r\n\r\n            6.1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will\r\n            terminate automatically if You fail to comply with terms\r\n            herein and fail to cure such breach within 30 days of\r\n            becoming aware of the breach. Provisions which, by their\r\n            nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of\r\n            this License shall survive.\r\n\r\n            6.2. If You assert a patent infringement claim (excluding\r\n            declaratory judgment actions) against Initial Developer or\r\n            a Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against\r\n            whom You assert such claim is referred to as Participant)\r\n            alleging that the Participant Software (meaning the\r\n            Contributor Version where the Participant is a Contributor\r\n            or the Original Software where the Participant is the\r\n            Initial Developer) directly or indirectly infringes any\r\n            patent, then any and all rights granted directly or\r\n            indirectly to You by such Participant, the Initial\r\n            Developer (if the Initial Developer is not the Participant)\r\n            and all Contributors under Sections 2.1 and\/or 2.2 of this\r\n            License shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant\r\n            terminate prospectively and automatically at the expiration\r\n            of such 60 day notice period, unless if within such 60 day\r\n            period You withdraw Your claim with respect to the\r\n            Participant Software against such Participant either\r\n            unilaterally or pursuant to a written agreement with\r\n            Participant.\r\n\r\n            6.3. In the event of termination under Sections 6.1 or 6.2\r\n            above, all end user licenses that have been validly granted\r\n            by You or any distributor hereunder prior to termination\r\n            (excluding licenses granted to You by any distributor)\r\n            shall survive termination.\r\n\r\n      7. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.\r\n\r\n      UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT\r\n      (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE\r\n      INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF\r\n      COVERED SOFTWARE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE\r\n      LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR\r\n      CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT\r\n      LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOST PROFITS, LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK\r\n      STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER\r\n      COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN\r\n      INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF\r\n      LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL\r\n      INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT\r\n      APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO\r\n      NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR\r\n      CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT\r\n      APPLY TO YOU.\r\n\r\n      8. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.\r\n\r\n      The Covered Software is a commercial item, as that term is\r\n      defined in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of commercial\r\n      computer software (as that term is defined at 48 C.F.R. \r\n      252.227-7014(a)(1)) and commercial computer software\r\n      documentation as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept.\r\n      1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1\r\n      through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users\r\n      acquire Covered Software with only those rights set forth herein.\r\n      This U.S. Government Rights clause is in lieu of, and supersedes,\r\n      any other FAR, DFAR, or other clause or provision that addresses\r\n      Government rights in computer software under this License.\r\n\r\n      9. MISCELLANEOUS.\r\n\r\n      This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject\r\n      matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be\r\n      unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the\r\n      extent necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be\r\n      governed by the law of the jurisdiction specified in a notice\r\n      contained within the Original Software (except to the extent\r\n      applicable law, if any, provides otherwise), excluding such\r\n      jurisdiction's conflict-of-law provisions. Any litigation\r\n      relating to this License shall be subject to the jurisdiction of\r\n      the courts located in the jurisdiction and venue specified in a\r\n      notice contained within the Original Software, with the losing\r\n      party responsible for costs, including, without limitation, court\r\n      costs and reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses. The\r\n      application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the\r\n      International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any law or\r\n      regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall\r\n      be construed against the drafter shall not apply to this License.\r\n      You agree that You alone are responsible for compliance with the\r\n      United States export administration regulations (and the export\r\n      control laws and regulation of any other countries) when You use,\r\n      distribute or otherwise make available any Covered Software.\r\n\r\n      10. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.\r\n\r\n      As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is\r\n      responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or\r\n      indirectly, out of its utilization of rights under this License\r\n      and You agree to work with Initial Developer and Contributors to\r\n      distribute such responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing\r\n      herein is intended or shall be deemed to constitute any admission\r\n      of liability.\r\n",

If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed. Any patent license granted hereby with respect to contributions by an individual employed by an institution or organization is limited to patent claims where the individual that is the author of the Work is also the inventor of the patent claims licensed, and where the organization or institution has the right to grant such license under applicable grant and research funding agreements.

(\"Licensor\"). Any BitTorrent Product licensed pursuant to this License is a Licensed Product. Licensed Product, in its entirety, is protected by U.S. copyright law. This License identifies the terms under which you may use, copy, distribute or modify Licensed Product.\r\n\r\nPreamble\r\n\r\nThis Preamble is intended to describe, in plain English, the nature and scope of this License. However, this Preamble is not a part of this license. The legal effect of this License is dependent only upon the terms of the License and not this Preamble.\r\n\r\nThis License complies with the Open Source Definition and is derived from the Jabber Open Source License 1.0 (the \"JOSL\"), which has been approved by Open Source Initiative. Sections 4(c) and 4(f)(iii) from the JOSL have been deleted.\r\n\r\nThis License provides that:\r\n\r\n1. You may use or give away the Licensed Product, alone or as a component of an aggregate software distribution containing programs from several different sources. No royalty or other fee is required.\r\n\r\n2. Both Source Code and executable versions of the Licensed Product, including Modifications made by previous Contributors, are available for your use. (The terms \"Licensed Product,\" \"Modifications,\" \"Contributors\" and \"Source Code\" are defined in the License.)\r\n\r\n3. You are allowed to make Modifications to the Licensed Product, and you can create Derivative Works from it. (The term \"Derivative Works\" is defined in the License.)\r\n\r\n4. By accepting the Licensed Product under the provisions of this License, you agree that any Modifications you make to the Licensed Product and then distribute are governed by the provisions of this License. In particular, you must make the Source Code of your Modifications available to others free of charge and without a royalty.\r\n\r\n5. You may sell, accept donations or otherwise receive compensation for executable versions of a Licensed Product, without paying a royalty or other fee to the Licensor or any Contributor, provided that such executable versions contain your or another Contributor?s material Modifications. For the avoidance of doubt, to the extent your executable version of a Licensed Product does not contain your or another Contributor?s material Modifications, you may not sell, accept donations or otherwise receive compensation for such executable.\r\n\r\nYou may use the Licensed Product for any purpose, but the Licensor is not providing you any warranty whatsoever, nor is the Licensor accepting any liability in the event that the Licensed Product doesn't work properly or causes you any injury or damages.\r\n\r\n6. If you sublicense the Licensed Product or Derivative Works, you may charge fees for warranty or support, or for accepting indemnity or liability obligations to your customers. You cannot charge for, sell, accept donations or otherwise receive compensation for the Source Code.\r\n\r\n7. If you assert any patent claims against the Licensor relating to the Licensed Product, or if you breach any terms of the License, your rights to the Licensed Product under this License automatically terminate.\r\n\r\nYou may use this License to distribute your own Derivative Works, in which case the provisions of this License will apply to your Derivative Works just as they do to the original Licensed Product.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, you may distribute your Derivative Works under any other OSI-approved Open Source license, or under a proprietary license of your choice. If you use any license other than this License, however, you must continue to fulfill the requirements of this License (including the provisions relating to publishing the Source Code) for those portions of your Derivative Works that consist of the Licensed Product, including the files containing Modifications.\r\n\r\nNew versions of this License may be published from time to time in connection with new versions of a Licensed Product or otherwise. You may choose to continue to use the license terms in this version of the License for the Licensed Product that was originally licensed hereunder, however, the new versions of this License will at all times apply to new versions of the Licensed Product released by Licensor after the release of the new version of this License. Only the Licensor has the right to change the License terms as they apply to the Licensed Product.\r\n\r\nThis License relies on precise definitions for certain terms. Those terms are defined when they are first used, and the definitions are repeated for your convenience in a Glossary at the end of the License.\r\n\r\nLicense Terms\r\n\r\n1. Grant of License From Licensor. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, Licensor hereby grants you a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive license, subject to third party intellectual property claims, to do the following:\r\n\r\na. Use, reproduce, modify, display, perform, sublicense and distribute any Modifications created by a Contributor or portions thereof, in both Source Code or as an executable program, either on an unmodified basis or as part of Derivative Works.\r\n\r\nb. Under claims of patents now or hereafter owned or controlled by Contributor, to make, use, sell, offer for sale, have made, and\/or otherwise dispose of Modifications or portions thereof, but solely to the extent that any such claim is necessary to enable you to make, use, sell, offer for sale, have made, and\/or otherwise dispose of Modifications or portions thereof or Derivative Works thereof.\r\n\r\n2. Grant of License to Modifications From Contributor. \"Modifications\" means any additions to or deletions from the substance or structure of (i) a file containing a Licensed Product, or (ii) any new file that contains any part of a Licensed Product. Hereinafter in this License, the term \"Licensed Product\" shall include all previous Modifications that you receive from any Contributor. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, By application of the provisions in Section 4(a) below, each person or entity who created or contributed to the creation of, and distributed, a Modification (a \"Contributor\") hereby grants you a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive license, subject to third party intellectual property claims, to do the following:\r\n\r\na. Use, reproduce, modify, display, perform, sublicense and distribute any Modifications created by such Contributor or portions thereof, in both Source Code or as an executable program, either on an unmodified basis or as part of Derivative Works.\r\n\r\nb. Under claims of patents now or hereafter owned or controlled by Contributor, to make, use, sell, offer for sale, have made, and\/or otherwise dispose of Modifications or portions thereof, but solely to the extent that any such claim is necessary to enable you to make, use, sell, offer for sale, have made, and\/or otherwise dispose of Modifications or portions thereof or Derivative Works thereof.\r\n\r\n3. Exclusions From License Grant. Nothing in this License shall be deemed to grant any rights to trademarks, copyrights, patents, trade secrets or any other intellectual property of Licensor or any Contributor except as expressly stated herein. No patent license is granted separate from the Licensed Product, for code that you delete from the Licensed Product, or for combinations of the Licensed Product with other software or hardware. No right is granted to the trademarks of Licensor or any Contributor even if such marks are included in the Licensed Product. Nothing in this License shall be interpreted to prohibit Licensor from licensing under different terms from this License any code that Licensor otherwise would have a right to license. As an express condition for your use of the Licensed Product, you hereby agree that you will not, without the prior written consent of Licensor, use any trademarks, copyrights, patents, trade secrets or any other intellectual property of Licensor or any Contributor except as expressly stated herein. For the avoidance of doubt and without limiting the foregoing, you hereby agree that you will not use or display any trademark of Licensor or any Contributor in any domain name, directory filepath, advertisement, link or other reference to you in any manner or in any media.\r\n\r\n4. Your Obligations Regarding Distribution.\r\n\r\na. Application of This License to Your Modifications. As an express condition for your use of the Licensed Product, you hereby agree that any Modifications that you create or to which you contribute, and which you distribute, are governed by the terms of this License including, without limitation, Section 2. Any Modifications that you create or to which you contribute may be distributed only under the terms of this License or a future version of this License released under Section 7. You must include a copy of this License with every copy of the Modifications you distribute. You agree not to offer or impose any terms on any Source Code or executable version of the Licensed Product or Modifications that alter or restrict the applicable version of this License or the recipients' rights hereunder. However, you may include an additional document offering the additional rights described in Section 4(d).\r\n\r\nb. Availability of Source Code. You must make available, without charge, under the terms of this License, the Source Code of the Licensed Product and any Modifications that you distribute, either on the same media as you distribute any executable or other form of the Licensed Product, or via a mechanism generally accepted in the software development community for the electronic transfer of data (an \"Electronic Distribution Mechanism\"). The Source Code for any version of Licensed Product or Modifications that you distribute must remain available for as long as any executable or other form of the Licensed Product is distributed by you. You are responsible for ensuring that the Source Code version remains available even if the Electronic Distribution Mechanism is maintained by a third party.\r\n\r\nc. Intellectual Property Matters.\r\n\r\ni. Third Party Claims. If you have knowledge that a license to a third party's intellectual property right is required to exercise the rights granted by this License, you must include a text file with the Source Code distribution titled \"LEGAL\" that describes the claim and the party making the claim in sufficient detail that a recipient will know whom to contact. If you obtain such knowledge after you make any Modifications available as described in Section 4(b), you shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies you make available thereafter and shall take other steps (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably calculated to inform those who received the Licensed Product from you that new knowledge has been obtained.\r\n\r\nii. Contributor APIs. If your Modifications include an application programming interface (\"API\") and you have knowledge of patent licenses that are reasonably necessary to implement that API, you must also include this information in the LEGAL file.\r\n\r\niii. Representations. You represent that, except as disclosed pursuant to 4(c)(i) above, you believe that any Modifications you distribute are your original creations and that you have sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by this License.\r\n\r\nd. Required Notices. You must duplicate this License in any documentation you provide along with the Source Code of any Modifications you create or to which you contribute, and which you distribute, wherever you describe recipients' rights relating to Licensed Product. You must duplicate the notice contained in Exhibit A (the \"Notice\") in each file of the Source Code of any copy you distribute of the Licensed Product. If you created a Modification, you may add your name as a Contributor to the Notice. If it is not possible to put the Notice in a particular Source Code file due to its structure, then you must include such Notice in a location (such as a relevant directory file) where a user would be likely to look for such a notice. You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Licensed Product. However, you may do so only on your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Licensor or any Contributor. You must make it clear that any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by you alone, and you hereby agree to indemnify the Licensor and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Licensor or such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms you offer.\r\n\r\ne. Distribution of Executable Versions. You may distribute Licensed Product as an executable program under a license of your choice that may contain terms different from this License provided (i) you have satisfied the requirements of Sections 4(a) through 4(d) for that distribution, (ii) you include a conspicuous notice in the executable version, related documentation and collateral materials stating that the Source Code version of the Licensed Product is available under the terms of this License, including a description of how and where you have fulfilled the obligations of Section 4(b), and (iii) you make it clear that any terms that differ from this License are offered by you alone, not by Licensor or any Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the Licensor and every Contributor for any liability incurred by Licensor or such Contributor as a result of any terms you offer.\r\n\r\nf. Distribution of Derivative Works. You may create Derivative Works (e.g., combinations of some or all of the Licensed Product with other code) and distribute the Derivative Works as products under any other license you select, with the proviso that the requirements of this License are fulfilled for those portions of the Derivative Works that consist of the Licensed Product or any Modifications thereto.\r\n\r\ng. Compensation for Distribution of Executable Versions of Licensed Products, Modifications or Derivative Works. Notwithstanding any provision of this License to the contrary, by distributing, selling, licensing, sublicensing or otherwise making available any Licensed Product, or Modification or Derivative Work thereof, you and Licensor hereby acknowledge and agree that you may sell, license or sublicense for a fee, accept donations or otherwise receive compensation for executable versions of a Licensed Product, without paying a royalty or other fee to the Licensor or any other Contributor, provided that such executable versions (i) contain your or another Contributor?s material Modifications, or (ii) are otherwise material Derivative Works. For purposes of this License, an executable version of the Licensed Product will be deemed to contain a material Modification, or will otherwise be deemed a material Derivative Work, if (a) the Licensed Product is modified with your own or a third party?s software programs or other code, and\/or the Licensed Product is combined with a number of your own or a third party?s software programs or code, respectively, and (b) such software programs or code add or contribute material value, functionality or features to the License Product. For the avoidance of doubt, to the extent your executable version of a Licensed Product does not contain your or another Contributor?s material Modifications or is otherwise not a material Derivative Work, in each case as contemplated herein, you may not sell, license or sublicense for a fee, accept donations or otherwise receive compensation for such executable. Additionally, without limitation of the foregoing and notwithstanding any provision of this License to the contrary, you cannot charge for, sell, license or sublicense for a fee, accept donations or otherwise receive compensation for the Source Code.\r\n\r\n5. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation. If it is impossible for you to comply with any of the terms of this License with respect to some or all of the Licensed Product due to statute, judicial order, or regulation, then you must (i) comply with the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible, (ii) cite the statute or regulation that prohibits you from adhering to the License, and (iii) describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must be included in the LEGAL file described in Section 4(d), and must be included with all distributions of the Source Code. Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill at computer programming to be able to understand it.\r\n\r\n6. Application of This License. This License applies to code to which Licensor or Contributor has attached the Notice in Exhibit A, which is incorporated herein by this reference.\r\n\r\n7. Versions of This License.\r\n\r\na. New Versions. Licensor may publish from time to time revised and\/or new versions of the License.\r\n\r\nb. Effect of New Versions. Once Licensed Product has been published under a particular version of the License, you may always continue to use it under the terms of that version, provided that any such license be in full force and effect at the time, and has not been revoked or otherwise terminated. You may also choose to use such Licensed Product under the terms of any subsequent version (but not any prior version) of the License published by Licensor. No one other than Licensor has the right to modify the terms applicable to Licensed Product created under this License.\r\n\r\nc. Derivative Works of this License. If you create or use a modified version of this License, which you may do only in order to apply it to software that is not already a Licensed Product under this License, you must rename your license so that it is not confusingly similar to this License, and must make it clear that your license contains terms that differ from this License. In so naming your license, you may not use any trademark of Licensor or any Contributor.\r\n\r\n8. Disclaimer of Warranty. LICENSED PRODUCT IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN AS IS BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE LICENSED PRODUCT IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE LICENSED PRODUCT IS WITH YOU. SHOULD LICENSED PRODUCT PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (AND NOT THE LICENSOR OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF LICENSED PRODUCT IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.\r\n\r\n9. Termination.\r\n\r\na. Automatic Termination Upon Breach. This license and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically if you fail to comply with the terms herein and fail to cure such breach within ten (10) days of being notified of the breach by the Licensor. For purposes of this provision, proof of delivery via email to the address listed in the ?WHOIS? database of the registrar for any website through which you distribute or market any Licensed Product, or to any alternate email address which you designate in writing to the Licensor, shall constitute sufficient notification. All sublicenses to the Licensed Product that are properly granted shall survive any termination of this license so long as they continue to complye with the terms of this License. Provisions that, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License, shall survive.\r\n\r\nb. Termination Upon Assertion of Patent Infringement. If you initiate litigation by asserting a patent infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions) against Licensor or a Contributor (Licensor or Contributor against whom you file such an action is referred to herein as Respondent) alleging that Licensed Product directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted by such Respondent to you under Sections 1 or 2 of this License shall terminate prospectively upon sixty (60) days notice from Respondent (the \"Notice Period\") unless within that Notice Period you either agree in writing (i) to pay Respondent a mutually agreeable reasonably royalty for your past or future use of Licensed Product made by such Respondent, or (ii) withdraw your litigation claim with respect to Licensed Product against such Respondent. If within said Notice Period a reasonable royalty and payment arrangement are not mutually agreed upon in writing by the parties or the litigation claim is not withdrawn, the rights granted by Licensor to you under Sections 1 and 2 automatically terminate at the expiration of said Notice Period.\r\n\r\nc. Reasonable Value of This License. If you assert a patent infringement claim against Respondent alleging that Licensed Product directly or indirectly infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as by license or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses granted by said Respondent under Sections 1 and 2 shall be taken into account in determining the amount or value of any payment or license.\r\n\r\nd. No Retroactive Effect of Termination. In the event of termination under Sections 9(a) or 9(b) above, all end user license agreements (excluding licenses to distributors and resellers) that have been validly granted by you or any distributor hereunder prior to termination shall survive termination.\r\n\r\n10. Limitation of Liability. UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL THE LICENSOR, ANY CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF LICENSED PRODUCT, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTYS NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\r\n\r\n11. Responsibility for Claims. As between Licensor and Contributors, each party is responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly, out of its utilization of rights under this License. You agree to work with Licensor and Contributors to distribute such responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing herein is intended or shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability.\r\n\r\n12. U.S. Government End Users. The Licensed Product is a commercial item, as that term is defined in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of commercial computer software and commercial computer software documentation, as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users acquire Licensed Product with only those rights set forth herein.\r\n\r\n13. Miscellaneous. This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be governed by California law provisions (except to the extent applicable law, if any, provides otherwise), excluding its conflict-of-law provisions. You expressly agree that in any litigation relating to this license the losing party shall be responsible for costs including, without limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys fees and expenses. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any law or regulation that provides that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not apply to this License.\r\n\r\n14. Definition of You in This License. You throughout this License, whether in upper or lower case, means an individual or a legal entity exercising rights under, and complying with all of the terms of, this License or a future version of this License issued under Section 7. For legal entities, you includes any entity that controls, is controlled by, is under common control with, or affiliated with, you.

DISTRIBUTION OF THIS LICENSE DOES NOT CREATE AN ATTORNEY-CLIENT RELATIONSHIP. CREATIVE COMMONS PROVIDES THIS INFORMATION ON AN \"AS-IS\" BASIS. CREATIVE COMMONS MAKES NO WARRANTIES REGARDING THE INFORMATION PROVIDED, AND DISCLAIMS LIABILITY FOR DAMAGES RESULTING FROM ITS USE.\r\nLicense\r\n\r\nTHE WORK (AS DEFINED BELOW) IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS CREATIVE COMMONS PUBLIC LICENSE (\"CCPL\" OR \"LICENSE\"). THE WORK IS PROTECTED BY COPYRIGHT AND\/OR OTHER APPLICABLE LAW. ANY USE OF THE WORK OTHER THAN AS AUTHORIZED UNDER THIS LICENSE OR COPYRIGHT LAW IS PROHIBITED.\r\n\r\nBY EXERCISING ANY RIGHTS TO THE WORK PROVIDED HERE, YOU ACCEPT AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE. THE LICENSOR GRANTS YOU THE RIGHTS CONTAINED HERE IN CONSIDERATION OF YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF SUCH TERMS AND CONDITIONS.\r\n\r\n1. Definitions\r\n\r\n\"Collective Work\" means a work, such as a periodical issue, anthology or encyclopedia, in which the Work in its entirety in unmodified form, along with a number of other contributions, constituting separate and independent works in themselves, are assembled into a collective whole. A work that constitutes a Collective Work will not be considered a Derivative Work (as defined below) for the purposes of this License.\r\n\"Derivative Work\" means a work based upon the Work or upon the Work and other pre-existing works, such as a translation, musical arrangement, dramatization, fictionalization, motion picture version, sound recording, art reproduction, abridgment, condensation, or any other form in which the Work may be recast, transformed, or adapted, except that a work that constitutes a Collective Work will not be considered a Derivative Work for the purpose of this License. For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a musical composition or sound recording, the synchronization of the Work in timed-relation with a moving image (\"synching\") will be considered a Derivative Work for the purpose of this License.\r\n\"Licensor\" means the individual or entity that offers the Work under the terms of this License.\r\n\"Original Author\" means the individual or entity who created the Work.\r\n\"Work\" means the copyrightable work of authorship offered under the terms of this License.\r\n\"You\" means an individual or entity exercising rights under this License who has not previously violated the terms of this License with respect to the Work, or who has received express permission from the Licensor to exercise rights under this License despite a previous violation.\r\n2. Fair Use Rights. Nothing in this license is intended to reduce, limit, or restrict any rights arising from fair use, first sale or other limitations on the exclusive rights of the copyright owner under copyright law or other applicable laws.\r\n\r\n3. License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright) license to exercise the rights in the Work as stated below:\r\n\r\nto reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more Collective Works, and to reproduce the Work as incorporated in the Collective Works;\r\nto create and reproduce Derivative Works;\r\nto distribute copies or phonorecords of, display publicly, perform publicly, and perform publicly by means of a digital audio transmission the Work including as incorporated in Collective Works;\r\nto distribute copies or phonorecords of, display publicly, perform publicly, and perform publicly by means of a digital audio transmission Derivative Works.\r\nFor the avoidance of doubt, where the work is a musical composition:\r\n\r\nPerformance Royalties Under Blanket Licenses. Licensor waives the exclusive right to collect, whether individually or via a performance rights society (e.g. ASCAP, BMI, SESAC), royalties for the public performance or public digital performance (e.g. webcast) of the Work.\r\nMechanical Rights and Statutory Royalties. Licensor waives the exclusive right to collect, whether individually or via a music rights agency or designated agent (e.g. Harry Fox Agency), royalties for any phonorecord You create from the Work (\"cover version\") and distribute, subject to the compulsory license created by 17 USC Section 115 of the US Copyright Act (or the equivalent in other jurisdictions).\r\nWebcasting Rights and Statutory Royalties. For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a sound recording, Licensor waives the exclusive right to collect, whether individually or via a performance-rights society (e.g. SoundExchange), royalties for the public digital performance (e.g. webcast) of the Work, subject to the compulsory license created by 17 USC Section 114 of the US Copyright Act (or the equivalent in other jurisdictions).\r\nThe above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now known or hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make such modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights in other media and formats. All rights not expressly granted by Licensor are hereby reserved.\r\n\r\n4. Restrictions.The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made subject to and limited by the following restrictions:\r\n\r\nYou may distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform the Work only under the terms of this License, and You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier for, this License with every copy or phonorecord of the Work You distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on the Work that alter or restrict the terms of this License or the recipients' exercise of the rights granted hereunder. You may not sublicense the Work. You must keep intact all notices that refer to this License and to the disclaimer of warranties. You may not distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform the Work with any technological measures that control access or use of the Work in a manner inconsistent with the terms of this License Agreement. The above applies to the Work as incorporated in a Collective Work, but this does not require the Collective Work apart from the Work itself to be made subject to the terms of this License. If You create a Collective Work, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Collective Work any credit as required by clause 4(b), as requested. If You create a Derivative Work, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Derivative Work any credit as required by clause 4(b), as requested.\r\nIf you distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform the Work or any Derivative Works or Collective Works, You must keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and provide, reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing: (i) the name of the Original Author (or pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied, and\/or (ii) if the Original Author and\/or Licensor designate another party or parties (e.g. a sponsor institute, publishing entity, journal) for attribution in Licensor's copyright notice, terms of service or by other reasonable means, the name of such party or parties; the title of the Work if supplied; to the extent reasonably practicable, the Uniform Resource Identifier, if any, that Licensor specifies to be associated with the Work, unless such URI does not refer to the copyright notice or licensing information for the Work; and in the case of a Derivative Work, a credit identifying the use of the Work in the Derivative Work (e.g., \"French translation of the Work by Original Author,\" or \"Screenplay based on original Work by Original Author\"). Such credit may be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however, that in the case of a Derivative Work or Collective Work, at a minimum such credit will appear where any other comparable authorship credit appears and in a manner at least as prominent as such other comparable authorship credit.\r\n5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer\r\n\r\nUNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\r\n\r\n6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\r\n\r\n7. Termination\r\n\r\nThis License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this License. Individuals or entities who have received Derivative Works or Collective Works from You under this License, however, will not have their licenses terminated provided such individuals or entities remain in full compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any termination of this License.\r\nSubject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work). Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the Work under different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time; provided, however that any such election will not serve to withdraw this License (or any other license that has been, or is required to be, granted under the terms of this License), and this License will continue in full force and effect unless terminated as stated above.\r\n8. Miscellaneous\r\n\r\nEach time You distribute or publicly digitally perform the Work or a Collective Work, the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.\r\nEach time You distribute or publicly digitally perform a Derivative Work, Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the original Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.\r\nIf any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this License, and without further action by the parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.\r\nNo term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or consent.\r\nThis License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings, agreements or representations with respect to the Work not specified here. Licensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions that may appear in any communication from You. This License may not be modified without the mutual written agreement of the Licensor and You.\r\nCreative Commons is not a party to this License, and makes no warranty whatsoever in connection with the Work.

Eclipse has designated the Eclipse Public License (EPL) as the follow-on version of the CPL.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS COMMON PUBLIC LICENSE (\"AGREEMENT\"). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. DEFINITIONS\r\n\r\n\"Contribution\" means:\r\n\r\na) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial code and documentation distributed under this Agreement, and\r\nb) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:\r\ni)\t changes to the Program, and\r\nii)\t additions to the Program;\r\nwhere such changes and\/or additions to the Program originate from and are distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution 'originates' from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor's behalf. Contributions do not include additions to the Program which: (i) are separate modules of software distributed in conjunction with the Program under their own license agreement, and (ii) are not derivative works of the Program.\r\n\r\n\"Contributor\" means any person or entity that distributes the Program.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Licensed Patents \" mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone or when combined with the Program.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Program\" means the Contributions distributed in accordance with this Agreement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Recipient\" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement, including all Contributors.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. GRANT OF RIGHTS\r\n\r\na)\tSubject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, and such derivative works, in source code and object code form.\r\nb) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in source code and object code form. This patent license shall apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is licensed hereunder.\r\nc)\tRecipient understands that although each Contributor grants the licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity. Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party patent license is required to allow Recipient to distribute the Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license before distributing the Program.\r\nd)\tEach Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright license set forth in this Agreement.\r\n3. REQUIREMENTS\r\n\r\nA Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form under its own license agreement, provided that:\r\n\r\na)\tit complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and\r\nb)\tits license agreement:\r\ni)\teffectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties and conditions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose;\r\nii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits;\r\niii)\tstates that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are offered by that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and\r\niv)\tstates that source code for the Program is available from such Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily used for software exchange.\r\nWhen the Program is made available in source code form:\r\n\r\na)\tit must be made available under this Agreement; and\r\nb)\ta copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the Program.\r\n\r\nContributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained within the Program.\r\n\r\n\r\nEach Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its Contribution, if any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent Recipients to identify the originator of the Contribution.\r\n\r\n\r\n4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION\r\n\r\nCommercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner which does not create potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering, such Contributor (\"Commercial Contributor\") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every other Contributor (\"Indemnified Contributor\") against any losses, damages and costs (collectively \"Losses\") arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program in a commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such claim at its own expense.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims against the other Contributors related to those performance claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay those damages.\r\n\r\n\r\n5. NO WARRANTY\r\n\r\nEXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN \"AS IS\" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement, including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.\r\n\r\n\r\n6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY\r\n\r\nEXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\r\n\r\n\r\n7. GENERAL\r\n\r\nIf any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf Recipient institutes patent litigation against a Contributor with respect to a patent applicable to software (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit), then any patent licenses granted by that Contributor to such Recipient under this Agreement shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed. In addition, if Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software or hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.\r\n\r\n\r\nAll Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable. However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement and any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and survive.\r\n\r\n\r\nEveryone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement, but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and may only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward reserves the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement from time to time. No one other than the Agreement Steward has the right to modify this Agreement. IBM is the initial Agreement Steward. IBM may assign the responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate entity. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing version number. The Program (including Contributions) may always be distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which it was received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is published, Contributor may elect to distribute the Program (including its Contributions) under the new version. Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual property of any Contributor under this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and the intellectual property laws of the United States of America. No party to this Agreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement more than one year after the cause of action arose. Each party waives its rights to a jury trial in any resulting litigation.",

CREATIVE COMMONS MAKES NO WARRANTIES REGARDING THE INFORMATION PROVIDED, AND DISCLAIMS LIABILITY FOR DAMAGES RESULTING FROM ITS USE.\r\nLicense\r\n\r\nTHE WORK (AS DEFINED BELOW) IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS CREATIVE COMMONS PUBLIC LICENSE (\"CCPL\" OR \"LICENSE\"). THE WORK IS PROTECTED BY COPYRIGHT AND\/OR OTHER APPLICABLE LAW. ANY USE OF THE WORK OTHER THAN AS AUTHORIZED UNDER THIS LICENSE OR COPYRIGHT LAW IS PROHIBITED.\r\n\r\nBY EXERCISING ANY RIGHTS TO THE WORK PROVIDED HERE, YOU ACCEPT AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE. THE LICENSOR GRANTS YOU THE RIGHTS CONTAINED HERE IN CONSIDERATION OF YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF SUCH TERMS AND CONDITIONS.\r\n\r\n1. Definitions\r\n\r\n\"Collective Work\" means a work, such as a periodical issue, anthology or encyclopedia, in which the Work in its entirety in unmodified form, along with a number of other contributions, constituting separate and independent works in themselves, are assembled into a collective whole. A work that constitutes a Collective Work will not be considered a Derivative Work (as defined below) for the purposes of this License.\r\n\"Derivative Work\" means a work based upon the Work or upon the Work and other pre-existing works, such as a translation, musical arrangement, dramatization, fictionalization, motion picture version, sound recording, art reproduction, abridgment, condensation, or any other form in which the Work may be recast, transformed, or adapted, except that a work that constitutes a Collective Work will not be considered a Derivative Work for the purpose of this License. For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a musical composition or sound recording, the synchronization of the Work in timed-relation with a moving image (\"synching\") will be considered a Derivative Work for the purpose of this License.\r\n\"Licensor\" means the individual or entity that offers the Work under the terms of this License.\r\n\"Original Author\" means the individual or entity who created the Work.\r\n\"Work\" means the copyrightable work of authorship offered under the terms of this License.\r\n\"You\" means an individual or entity exercising rights under this License who has not previously violated the terms of this License with respect to the Work, or who has received express permission from the Licensor to exercise rights under this License despite a previous violation.\r\n\"License Elements\" means the following high-level license attributes as selected by Licensor and indicated in the title of this License: Attribution, ShareAlike.\r\n2. Fair Use Rights. Nothing in this license is intended to reduce, limit, or restrict any rights arising from fair use, first sale or other limitations on the exclusive rights of the copyright owner under copyright law or other applicable laws.\r\n\r\n3. License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright) license to exercise the rights in the Work as stated below:\r\n\r\nto reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more Collective Works, and to reproduce the Work as incorporated in the Collective Works;\r\nto create and reproduce Derivative Works;\r\nto distribute copies or phonorecords of, display publicly, perform publicly, and perform publicly by means of a digital audio transmission the Work including as incorporated in Collective Works;\r\nto distribute copies or phonorecords of, display publicly, perform publicly, and perform publicly by means of a digital audio transmission Derivative Works.\r\nFor the avoidance of doubt, where the work is a musical composition:\r\n\r\nPerformance Royalties Under Blanket Licenses. Licensor waives the exclusive right to collect, whether individually or via a performance rights society (e.g. ASCAP, BMI, SESAC), royalties for the public performance or public digital performance (e.g. webcast) of the Work.\r\nMechanical Rights and Statutory Royalties. Licensor waives the exclusive right to collect, whether individually or via a music rights society or designated agent (e.g. Harry Fox Agency), royalties for any phonorecord You create from the Work (\"cover version\") and distribute, subject to the compulsory license created by 17 USC Section 115 of the US Copyright Act (or the equivalent in other jurisdictions).\r\nWebcasting Rights and Statutory Royalties. For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a sound recording, Licensor waives the exclusive right to collect, whether individually or via a performance-rights society (e.g. SoundExchange), royalties for the public digital performance (e.g. webcast) of the Work, subject to the compulsory license created by 17 USC Section 114 of the US Copyright Act (or the equivalent in other jurisdictions).\r\nThe above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now known or hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make such modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights in other media and formats. All rights not expressly granted by Licensor are hereby reserved.\r\n\r\n4. Restrictions.The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made subject to and limited by the following restrictions:\r\n\r\nYou may distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform the Work only under the terms of this License, and You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier for, this License with every copy or phonorecord of the Work You distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on the Work that alter or restrict the terms of this License or the recipients' exercise of the rights granted hereunder. You may not sublicense the Work. You must keep intact all notices that refer to this License and to the disclaimer of warranties. You may not distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform the Work with any technological measures that control access or use of the Work in a manner inconsistent with the terms of this License Agreement. The above applies to the Work as incorporated in a Collective Work, but this does not require the Collective Work apart from the Work itself to be made subject to the terms of this License. If You create a Collective Work, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Collective Work any credit as required by clause 4(c), as requested. If You create a Derivative Work, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Derivative Work any credit as required by clause 4(c), as requested.\r\nYou may distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform a Derivative Work only under the terms of this License, a later version of this License with the same License Elements as this License, or a Creative Commons iCommons license that contains the same License Elements as this License (e.g. Attribution-ShareAlike 2.5 Japan). You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier for, this License or other license specified in the previous sentence with every copy or phonorecord of each Derivative Work You distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on the Derivative Works that alter or restrict the terms of this License or the recipients' exercise of the rights granted hereunder, and You must keep intact all notices that refer to this License and to the disclaimer of warranties. You may not distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform the Derivative Work with any technological measures that control access or use of the Work in a manner inconsistent with the terms of this License Agreement. The above applies to the Derivative Work as incorporated in a Collective Work, but this does not require the Collective Work apart from the Derivative Work itself to be made subject to the terms of this License.\r\nIf you distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform the Work or any Derivative Works or Collective Works, You must keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and provide, reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing: (i) the name of the Original Author (or pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied, and\/or (ii) if the Original Author and\/or Licensor designate another party or parties (e.g. a sponsor institute, publishing entity, journal) for attribution in Licensor's copyright notice, terms of service or by other reasonable means, the name of such party or parties; the title of the Work if supplied; to the extent reasonably practicable, the Uniform Resource Identifier, if any, that Licensor specifies to be associated with the Work, unless such URI does not refer to the copyright notice or licensing information for the Work; and in the case of a Derivative Work, a credit identifying the use of the Work in the Derivative Work (e.g., \"French translation of the Work by Original Author,\" or \"Screenplay based on original Work by Original Author\"). Such credit may be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however, that in the case of a Derivative Work or Collective Work, at a minimum such credit will appear where any other comparable authorship credit appears and in a manner at least as prominent as such other comparable authorship credit.\r\n5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer\r\n\r\nUNLESS OTHERWISE AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE MATERIALS, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\r\n\r\n6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\r\n\r\n7. Termination\r\n\r\nThis License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this License. Individuals or entities who have received Derivative Works or Collective Works from You under this License, however, will not have their licenses terminated provided such individuals or entities remain in full compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any termination of this License.\r\nSubject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work). Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the Work under different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time; provided, however that any such election will not serve to withdraw this License (or any other license that has been, or is required to be, granted under the terms of this License), and this License will continue in full force and effect unless terminated as stated above.\r\n8. Miscellaneous\r\n\r\nEach time You distribute or publicly digitally perform the Work or a Collective Work, the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.\r\nEach time You distribute or publicly digitally perform a Derivative Work, Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the original Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.\r\nIf any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this License, and without further action by the parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.\r\nNo term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or consent.\r\nThis License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings, agreements or representations with respect to the Work not specified here. Licensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions that may appear in any communication from You. This License may not be modified without the mutual written agreement of the Licensor and You.\r\nCreative Commons is not a party to this License, and makes no warranty whatsoever in connection with the Work. Creative Commons will not be liable to You or any party on any legal theory for any damages whatsoever, including without limitation any general, special, incidental or consequential damages arising in connection to this license. Notwithstanding the foregoing two (2) sentences, if Creative Commons has expressly identified itself as the Licensor hereunder, it shall have all rights and obligations of Licensor.\r\n\r\nExcept for the limited purpose of indicating to the public that the Work is licensed under the CCPL, neither party will use the trademark \"Creative Commons\" or any related trademark or logo of Creative Commons without the prior written consent of Creative Commons. Any permitted use will be in compliance with Creative Commons' then-current trademark usage guidelines, as may be published on its website or otherwise made available upon request from time to time.\r\n\r\nCreative Commons may be contacted at http:\/\/creativecommons.org\/.",

Distribution Obligations.\r\n\r\n3.1. Application of License.\r\nThe Modifications which You create or to which You contribute are\r\ngoverned by the terms of this License, including without limitation\r\nSection 2.2. The Source Code version of Covered Code may be\r\ndistributed only under the terms of this License or a future version\r\nof this License released under Section 6.1, and You must include a\r\ncopy of this License with every copy of the Source Code You\r\ndistribute. You may not offer or impose any terms on any Source Code\r\nversion that alters or restricts the applicable version of this\r\nLicense or the recipients' rights hereunder. However, You may include\r\nan additional document offering the additional rights described in\r\nSection 3.5.\r\n\r\n3.2. Availability of Source Code.\r\nAny Modification which You create or to which You contribute must be\r\nmade available in Source Code form under the terms of this License\r\neither on the same media as an Executable version or via an accepted\r\nElectronic Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom you made an\r\nExecutable version available; and if made available via Electronic\r\nDistribution Mechanism, must remain available for at least twelve (12)\r\nmonths after the date it initially became available, or at least six\r\n(6) months after a subsequent version of that particular Modification\r\nhas been made available to such recipients. You are responsible for\r\nensuring that the Source Code version remains available even if the\r\nElectronic Distribution Mechanism is maintained by a third party.\r\n\r\n3.3. Description of Modifications.\r\nYou must cause all Covered Code to which You contribute to contain a\r\nfile documenting the changes You made to create that Covered Code and\r\nthe date of any change. You must include a prominent statement that\r\nthe Modification is derived, directly or indirectly, from Original\r\nCode provided by the Initial Developer and including the name of the\r\nInitial Developer in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in any notice in an\r\nExecutable version or related documentation in which You describe the\r\norigin or ownership of the Covered Code.\r\n\r\n3.4. Intellectual Property Matters\r\n\r\n(a) Third Party Claims.\r\nIf Contributor has knowledge that a license under a third party's\r\nintellectual property rights is required to exercise the rights\r\ngranted by such Contributor under Sections 2.1 or 2.2,\r\nContributor must include a text file with the Source Code\r\ndistribution titled \"LEGAL\" which describes the claim and the\r\nparty making the claim in sufficient detail that a recipient will\r\nknow whom to contact. If Contributor obtains such knowledge after\r\nthe Modification is made available as described in Section 3.2,\r\nContributor shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies\r\nContributor makes available thereafter and shall take other steps\r\n(such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups)\r\nreasonably calculated to inform those who received the Covered\r\nCode that new knowledge has been obtained.\r\n\r\n(b) Contributor APIs.\r\n\r\nIf Contributor's Modifications include an application programming\r\ninterface and Contributor has knowledge of patent licenses which\r\nare reasonably necessary to implement that API, Contributor must\r\nalso include this information in the LEGAL file.\r\n\r\n(c) Representations.\r\n\r\nContributor represents that, except as disclosed pursuant to\r\nSection 3.4(a) above, Contributor believes that Contributor's\r\nModifications are Contributor's original creation(s) and\/or\r\nContributor has sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by\r\nthis License.\r\n\r\n3.5. Required Notices.\r\nYou must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source\r\nCode. If it is not possible to put such notice in a particular Source\r\nCode file due to its structure, then You must include such notice in a\r\nlocation (such as a relevant directory) where a user would be likely\r\nto look for such a notice. If You created one or more Modification(s)\r\nYou may add your name as a Contributor to the notice described in\r\nExhibit A. You must also duplicate this License in any documentation\r\nfor the Source Code where You describe recipients' rights or ownership\r\nrights relating to Covered Code. You may choose to offer, and to\r\ncharge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability\r\nobligations to one or more recipients of Covered Code. However, You\r\nmay do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial\r\nDeveloper or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear than\r\nany such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is\r\noffered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial\r\nDeveloper and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the\r\nInitial Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty,\r\nsupport, indemnity or liability terms You offer.\r\n\r\n3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions.\r\nYou may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the\r\nrequirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered Code,\r\nand if You include a notice stating that the Source Code version of\r\nthe Covered Code is available under the terms of this License,\r\nincluding a description of how and where You have fulfilled the\r\nobligations of Section 3.2. The notice must be conspicuously included\r\nin any notice in an Executable version, related documentation or\r\ncollateral in which You describe recipients' rights relating to the\r\nCovered Code. You may distribute the Executable version of Covered\r\nCode or ownership rights under a license of Your choice, which may\r\ncontain terms different from this License, provided that You are in\r\ncompliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the\r\nExecutable version does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient's\r\nrights in the Source Code version from the rights set forth in this\r\nLicense. If You distribute the Executable version under a different\r\nlicense You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ\r\nfrom this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial\r\nDeveloper or any Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the\r\nInitial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by\r\nthe Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such\r\nterms You offer.\r\n\r\n3.7. Larger Works.\r\nYou may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other code\r\nnot governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger\r\nWork as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the\r\nrequirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code.\r\n\r\n4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.\r\n\r\nIf it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this\r\nLicense with respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to\r\nstatute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with\r\nthe terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b)\r\ndescribe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description\r\nmust be included in the LEGAL file described in Section 3.4 and must\r\nbe included with all distributions of the Source Code. Except to the\r\nextent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be\r\nsufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to\r\nunderstand it.\r\n\r\n5. Application of this License.\r\n\r\nThis License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has\r\nattached the notice in Exhibit A and to related Covered Code.\r\n\r\n6. Versions of the License.\r\n\r\n6.1. New Versions.\r\nCUA Office Project may publish revised\r\nand\/or new versions of the License from time to time. Each version\r\nwill be given a distinguishing version number.\r\n\r\n6.2. Effect of New Versions.\r\nOnce Covered Code has been published under a particular version of the\r\nLicense, You may always continue to use it under the terms of that\r\nversion. You may also choose to use such Covered Code under the terms\r\nof any subsequent version of the License published by CUA Office Project. No one\r\nother than CUA Office Project has the right to modify the terms applicable to\r\nCovered Code created under this License.\r\n\r\n6.3. Derivative Works.\r\nIf You create or use a modified version of this License (which you may\r\nonly do in order to apply it to code which is not already Covered Code\r\ngoverned by this License), You must (a) rename Your license so that\r\nthe phrases \"CUA Office\", \"CUA\", \"CUAPL\", or any confusingly similar phrase do not appear in your\r\nlicense (except to note that your license differs from this License)\r\nand (b) otherwise make it clear that Your version of the license\r\ncontains terms which differ from the CUA Office Public License. (Filling in the name of the Initial\r\nDeveloper, Original Code or Contributor in the notice described in\r\nExhibit A shall not of themselves be deemed to be modifications of\r\nthis License.)\r\n\r\n7. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.\r\n\r\nCOVERED CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN \"AS IS\" BASIS,\r\nWITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING,\r\nWITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED CODE IS FREE OF\r\nDEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING.\r\nTHE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED CODE\r\nIS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED CODE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT,\r\nYOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE\r\nCOST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER\r\nOF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF\r\nANY COVERED CODE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.\r\n\r\n8. TERMINATION.\r\n\r\n8.1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate\r\nautomatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure\r\nsuch breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. All\r\nsublicenses to the Covered Code which are properly granted shall\r\nsurvive any termination of this License. Provisions which, by their\r\nnature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License\r\nshall survive.\r\n\r\n8.2. If You initiate litigation by asserting a patent infringement\r\nclaim (excluding declatory judgment actions) against Initial Developer\r\nor a Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom\r\nYou file such action is referred to as \"Participant\") alleging that:\r\n\r\n(a) such Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly\r\ninfringes any patent, then any and all rights granted by such\r\nParticipant to You under Sections 2.1 and\/or 2.2 of this License\r\nshall, upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate prospectively,\r\nunless if within 60 days after receipt of notice You either: (i)\r\nagree in writing to pay Participant a mutually agreeable reasonable\r\nroyalty for Your past and future use of Modifications made by such\r\nParticipant, or (ii) withdraw Your litigation claim with respect to\r\nthe Contributor Version against such Participant. If within 60 days\r\nof notice, a reasonable royalty and payment arrangement are not\r\nmutually agreed upon in writing by the parties or the litigation claim\r\nis not withdrawn, the rights granted by Participant to You under\r\nSections 2.1 and\/or 2.2 automatically terminate at the expiration of\r\nthe 60 day notice period specified above.\r\n\r\n(b) any software, hardware, or device, other than such Participant's\r\nContributor Version, directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then\r\nany rights granted to You by such Participant under Sections 2.1(b)\r\nand 2.2(b) are revoked effective as of the date You first made, used,\r\nsold, distributed, or had made, Modifications made by that\r\nParticipant.\r\n\r\n8.3. If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant\r\nalleging that such Participant's Contributor Version directly or\r\nindirectly infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as\r\nby license or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent\r\ninfringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses\r\ngranted by such Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken\r\ninto account in determining the amount or value of any payment or\r\nlicense.\r\n\r\n8.4. In the event of termination under Sections 8.1 or 8.2 above,\r\nall end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers)\r\nwhich have been validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder\r\nprior to termination shall survive termination.\r\n\r\n9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.\r\n\r\nUNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT\r\n(INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL\r\nDEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED CODE,\r\nOR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR\r\nANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY\r\nCHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL,\r\nWORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER\r\nCOMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN\r\nINFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF\r\nLIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY\r\nRESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW\r\nPROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE\r\nEXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO\r\nTHIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\r\n\r\n10. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.\r\n\r\nThe Covered Code is a \"commercial item,\" as that term is defined in\r\n48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of \"commercial computer\r\nsoftware\" and \"commercial computer software documentation,\" as such\r\nterms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48\r\nC.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995),\r\nall U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Code with only those\r\nrights set forth herein.\r\n\r\n11. MISCELLANEOUS.\r\n\r\nThis License represents the complete agreement concerning subject\r\nmatter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be\r\nunenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent\r\nnecessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be governed by\r\nCalifornia law provisions (except to the extent applicable law, if\r\nany, provides otherwise), excluding its conflict-of-law provisions.\r\nWith respect to disputes in which at least one party is a citizen of,\r\nor an entity chartered or registered to do business in the United\r\nStates of America, any litigation relating to this License shall be\r\nsubject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Courts of the Northern\r\nDistrict of California, with venue lying in Santa Clara County,\r\nCalifornia, with the losing party responsible for costs, including\r\nwithout limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys' fees and\r\nexpenses. The application of the United Nations Convention on\r\nContracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded.\r\nAny law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract\r\nshall be construed against the drafter shall not apply to this\r\nLicense.\r\n\r\n12. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.\r\n\r\nAs between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is\r\nresponsible for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly,\r\nout of its utilization of rights under this License and You agree to\r\nwork with Initial Developer and Contributors to distribute such\r\nresponsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing herein is intended or\r\nshall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability.\r\n\r\n13. MULTIPLE-LICENSED CODE.\r\n\r\nInitial Developer may designate portions of the Covered Code as\r\n\"Multiple-Licensed\". \"Multiple-Licensed\" means that the Initial\r\nDeveloper permits you to utilize portions of the Covered Code under\r\nYour choice of the NPL or the alternative licenses, if any, specified\r\nby the Initial Developer in the file described in Exhibit A.\r\n\r\nEXHIBIT A - CUA Office Public License.\r\n\r\n``The contents of this file are subject to the CUA Office Public License\r\nVersion 1.0 (the \"License\"); you may not use this file except in\r\ncompliance with the License.

All Python licenses, unlike the GPL, let you distribute\r\n    a modified version without making your changes open source.  The\r\n    GPL-compatible licenses make it possible to combine Python with\r\n    other software that is released under the GPL; the others don't.\r\n\r\n(2) According to Richard Stallman, 1.6.1 is not GPL-compatible,\r\n    because its license has a choice of law clause.  According to\r\n    CNRI, however, Stallman's lawyer has told CNRI's lawyer that 1.6.1\r\n    is \"not incompatible\" with the GPL.\r\n\r\nThanks to the many outside volunteers who have worked under Guido's\r\ndirection to make these releases possible.\r\n\r\n\r\nB.

All Python licenses, unlike the GPL, let you distribute\r\n    a modified version without making your changes open source.  The\r\n    GPL-compatible licenses make it possible to combine Python with\r\n    other software that is released under the GPL; the others don't.\r\n\r\n(2) According to Richard Stallman, 1.6.1 is not GPL-compatible,\r\n    because its license has a choice of law clause.  According to\r\n    CNRI, however, Stallman's lawyer has told CNRI's lawyer that 1.6.1\r\n    is \"not incompatible\" with the GPL.\r\n\r\nThanks to the many outside volunteers who have worked under Guido's\r\ndirection to make these releases possible.\r\n\r\n\r\nB.

If Licensee does not agree to the additional license\r\nterms that accompany such Updates, Licensee may not install, copy, or otherwise use\r\nsuch Updates.\r\nUpon Licensee's acceptance of the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Nokia\r\ngrants Licensee the right to use the Licensed Software in the manner provided below.\r\n5. LICENSES\r\n5.1 Using, modifying and copying\r\nNokia grants to Licensee a non-exclusive, non-transferable, perpetual license to use,\r\nmodify and copy the Licensed Software for the Designated User(s) specified in the\r\nLicense Certificate for the sole purposes of designing, developing, and testing\r\nApplication(s).\r\n3\r\nLicensee may install copies of the Licensed Software on an unlimited number of\r\ncomputers provided that only the Designated Users use the Licensed Software.\r\nLicensee may at any time designate another Designated User to replace a then-current\r\nDesignated User by notifying Nokia, provided that a) the then-current Designated\r\nUser has not been designated as a replacement during the last six (6) months; and b)\r\nthere is no more than the specified number of Designated Users at any given time.\r\n5.2 Redistribution\r\na) Nokia grants Licensee a non-exclusive, royalty-free right to reproduce and\r\ndistribute the object code form of Redistributables for execution on the specified\r\nPlatforms. Copies of Redistributables may only be distributed with and for the sole\r\npurpose of executing Applications permitted under this Agreement that Licensee has\r\ncreated using the Licensed Software. Under no circumstances may any copies of\r\nRedistributables be distributed separately. This Agreement does not give Licensee\r\nany rights to distribute any of the parts of the Licensed Software listed in Appendix 1,\r\nSection 2, neither as a whole nor as parts or snippets of code.\r\nb) Licensee may not distribute, transfer, assign or otherwise dispose of Applications\r\nand\/or Redistributables, in binary\/compiled form, or in any other form, if such action\r\nis part of a joint software and hardware distribution, except as provided by a separate\r\nruntime distribution license with Nokia or one of its authorized distributors. A joint\r\nhardware and software distribution shall be defined as either:\r\n(i) distribution of a hardware device where, in its final end user\r\nconfiguration, the main user interface of the device is provided by\r\nApplication(s) created by Licensee or others, using a commercial\r\nversion of Qt or a Qt-based product, and depends on the Licensed\r\nSoftware or an open source version of any Qt or Qt-based software\r\nproduct; or\r\n(ii) distribution of the Licensed Software with a device designed to\r\nfacilitate the installation of the Licensed Software onto the same\r\ndevice where the main user interface of such device is provided by\r\nApplication(s) created by Licensee or others, using a commercial\r\nversion of Qt or a Qt-based product, and depends on the Licensed\r\nSoftware.\r\n5.3 Further Requirements\r\nThe licenses granted in this Section 5 by Nokia to Licensee are subject to Licensee\u2019s\r\ncompliance with Section 8 of this Agreement.\r\n6. VERIFICATION\r\nNokia or a certified auditor on Nokia\u2019s behalf, may, upon its reasonable request and\r\nat its expense, audit Licensee with respect to the use of the Licensed Software. Such\r\naudit may be conducted by mail, electronic means or through an in-person visit to\r\nLicensee\u2019s place of business. Any such in-person audit shall be conducted during\r\nregular business hours at Licensee's facilities and shall not unreasonably interfere\r\nwith Licensee's business activities. Nokia shall not remove, copy, or redistribute any\r\nelectronic material during the course of an audit. If an audit reveals that Licensee is\r\nusing the Licensed Software in a way that is in material violation of the terms of the\r\nAgreement, then Licensee shall pay Nokia's reasonable costs of conducting the audit.\r\nIn the case of a material violation, Licensee agrees to pay Nokia any amounts owing\r\n4\r\nthat are attributable to the unauthorized use. In the alternative, Nokia reserves the\r\nright, at Nokia's sole option, to terminate the licenses for the Licensed Software.\r\n7. THIRD PARTY SOFTWARE\r\nThe Licensed Software may provide links to third party libraries or code (collectively\r\n\"Third Party Software\") to implement various functions. Third Party Software does\r\nnot comprise part of the Licensed Software. In some cases, access to Third Party\r\nSoftware may be included along with the Licensed Software delivery as a\r\nconvenience for development and testing only.

Distribution Obligations.\r\n\r\n3.1. Application of License.\r\n\r\nThe Modifications which You create or to which You contribute are\r\ngoverned by the terms of this License, including without limitation\r\nSection 2.2. The Source Code version of Covered Code may be\r\ndistributed only under the terms of this License or a future version\r\nof this License released under Section 6.1, and You must include a\r\ncopy of this License with every copy of the Source Code You\r\ndistribute. You may not offer or impose any terms on any Source Code\r\nversion that alters or restricts the applicable version of this\r\nLicense or the recipients' rights hereunder. However, You may include\r\nan additional document offering the additional rights described in\r\nSection 3.5.\r\n\r\n3.2. Availability of Source Code.\r\n\r\nAny Modification which You create or to which You contribute must be\r\nmade available in Source Code form under the terms of this License\r\neither on the same media as an Executable version or via an accepted\r\nElectronic Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom you made an\r\nExecutable version available; and if made available via Electronic\r\nDistribution Mechanism, must remain available for at least twelve (12)\r\nmonths after the date it initially became available, or at least six\r\n(6) months after a subsequent version of that particular Modification\r\nhas been made available to such recipients. You are responsible for\r\nensuring that the Source Code version remains available even if the\r\nElectronic Distribution Mechanism is maintained by a third party.\r\n\r\n3.3. Description of Modifications.\r\n\r\nYou must cause all Covered Code to which You contribute to contain a\r\nfile documenting the changes You made to create that Covered Code and\r\nthe date of any change. You must include a prominent statement that\r\nthe Modification is derived, directly or indirectly, from Original\r\nCode provided by the Initial Developer and including the name of the\r\nInitial Developer in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in any notice in an\r\nExecutable version or related documentation in which You describe the\r\norigin or ownership of the Covered Code.\r\n\r\n3.4.

If\r\nContributor obtains such knowledge after the Modification is made\r\navailable as described in Section 3.2, Contributor shall promptly\r\nmodify the LEGAL file in all copies Contributor makes available\r\nthereafter and shall take other steps (such as notifying appropriate\r\nmailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably calculated to inform those who\r\nreceived the Covered Code that new knowledge has been obtained.\r\n\r\n(b) Contributor APIs.\r\n\r\nIf Contributor's Modifications include an application programming\r\ninterface (\"API\"..\/) and Contributor has knowledge of patent licenses\r\nwhich are reasonably necessary to implement that API, Contributor must\r\nalso include this information in the LEGAL file.\r\n\r\n(c) Representations.\r\n\r\nContributor represents that, except as disclosed pursuant to Section\r\n3.4(a) above, Contributor believes that Contributor's Modifications\r\nare Contributor's original creation(s) and\/or Contributor has\r\nsufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by this\r\nLicense\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\n3.5. Required Notices.\r\n\r\nYou must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source\r\nCode. If it is not possible to put such notice in a particular Source\r\nCode file due to its structure, then You must include such notice in a\r\nlocation (such as a relevant directory) where a user would be likely\r\nto look for such a notice. If You created one or more Modification(s)\r\nYou may add your name as a Contributor to the notice described in\r\nExhibit A. You must also duplicate this License in any documentation\r\nfor the Source Code where You describe recipients' rights or ownership\r\nrights relating to Covered Code. You may choose to offer, and to\r\ncharge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability\r\nobligations to one or more recipients of Covered Code. However, You\r\nmay do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial\r\nDeveloper or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear than\r\nany such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is\r\noffered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial\r\nDeveloper and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the\r\nInitial Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty,\r\nsupport, indemnity or liability terms You offer.\r\n\r\n3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions.\r\n\r\nYou may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the\r\nrequirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered Code,\r\nand if You include a notice stating that the Source Code version of\r\nthe Covered Code is available under the terms of this License,\r\nincluding a description of how and where You have fulfilled the\r\nobligations of Section 3.2. The notice must be conspicuously included\r\nin any notice in an Executable version, related documentation or\r\ncollateral in which You describe recipients' rights relating to the\r\nCovered Code. You may distribute the Executable version of Covered\r\nCode or ownership rights under a license of Your choice, which may\r\ncontain terms different from this License, provided that You are in\r\ncompliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the\r\nExecutable version does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient's\r\nrights in the Source Code version from the rights set forth in this\r\nLicense. If You distribute the Executable version under a different\r\nlicense You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ\r\nfrom this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial\r\nDeveloper or any Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the\r\nInitial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by\r\nthe Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such\r\nterms You offer.\r\n\r\n3.7.

In such a case, You must make sure the\r\nrequirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code.\r\n\r\n4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.\r\n\r\nIf it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this\r\nLicense with respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to\r\nstatute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with\r\nthe terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b)\r\ndescribe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description\r\nmust be included in the LEGAL file described in Section 3.4 and must\r\nbe included with all distributions of the Source Code. Except to the\r\nextent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be\r\nsufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to\r\nunderstand it.\r\n\r\n5. Application of this License.\r\n\r\nThis License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has\r\nattached the notice in Exhibit A and to related Covered Code.\r\n\r\n6. Versions of the License.\r\n\r\n6.1. New Versions.\r\n\r\nSun Microsystems, Inc. (\"Sun\") may publish revised and\/or new versions\r\nof the License from time to time. Each version will be given a\r\ndistinguishing version number.\r\n\r\n6.2. Effect of New Versions.\r\n\r\nOnce Covered Code has been published under a particular version of\r\nthe\r\nLicense, You may always continue to use it under the terms of that\r\nversion. You may also choose to use such Covered Code under the terms\r\nof any subsequent version of the License published by Sun. No one\r\nother than Sun has the right to modify the terms applicable to Covered\r\nCode created under this License.\r\n\r\n6.3.

(Filling in the name of the Initial Developer,\r\nOriginal Code or Contributor in the notice described in Exhibit A\r\nshall not of themselves be deemed to be modifications of this\r\nLicense.)\r\n\r\n7. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.\r\n\r\nCOVERED CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN \"..\/AS IS'' BASIS,\r\nWITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING,\r\nWITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED CODE IS FREE OF\r\nDEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING.\r\nTHE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED CODE\r\nIS WITH YOU.

THIS DISCLAIMER\r\nOF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF\r\nANY COVERED CODE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS\r\nDISCLAIMER.\r\n\r\n8. TERMINATION.\r\n\r\n8.1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate\r\nautomatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure\r\nsuch breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. All\r\nsublicenses to the Covered Code which are properly granted shall\r\nsurvive any termination of this License. Provisions which, by their\r\nnature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License\r\nshall survive.\r\n\r\n8.2. If You initiate litigation by asserting a patent infringement\r\nclaim (excluding declaratory judgment actions) against Initial Developer\r\nor a Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom\r\nYou file such action is referred to as \"Participant\") alleging\r\nthat:\r\n\r\n(a) such Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly\r\ninfringes any patent, then any and all rights granted by such\r\nParticipant to You under Sections 2.1 and\/or 2.2 of this License\r\nshall, upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate prospectively,\r\nunless if within 60 days after receipt of notice You either: (i)\r\nagree in writing to pay Participant a mutually agreeable reasonable\r\nroyalty for Your past and future use of Modifications made by such\r\nParticipant, or (ii) withdraw Your litigation claim with respect to\r\nthe Contributor Version against such Participant. If within 60 days\r\nof notice, a reasonable royalty and payment arrangement are not\r\nmutually agreed upon in writing by the parties or the litigation claim\r\nis not withdrawn, the rights granted by Participant to You under\r\nSections 2.1 and\/or 2.2 automatically terminate at the expiration of\r\nthe 60 day notice period specified above.\r\n\r\n(b) any software, hardware, or device, other than such Participant's\r\nContributor Version, directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then\r\nany rights granted to You by such Participant under Sections 2.1(b)\r\nand 2.2(b) are revoked effective as of the date You first made, used,\r\nsold, distributed, or had made, Modifications made by that\r\nParticipant.\r\n\r\n8.3. If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant\r\nalleging that such Participant's Contributor Version directly or\r\nindirectly infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as\r\nby license or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent\r\ninfringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses\r\ngranted by such Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken\r\ninto account in determining the amount or value of any payment or\r\nlicense.\r\n\r\n8.4. In the event of termination under Sections 8.1 or 8.2 above,\r\nall\r\nend user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers)\r\nwhich have been validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder\r\nprior to termination shall survive termination.\r\n\r\n9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.\r\n\r\nUNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT\r\n(INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL\r\nDEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED CODE,\r\nOR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR\r\nANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY\r\nCHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL,\r\nWORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER\r\nCOMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN\r\nINFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF\r\nLIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY\r\nRESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW\r\nPROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE\r\nEXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO\r\nTHIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\r\n\r\n10. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.\r\n\r\nThe Covered Code is a \"commercial item,\" as that term is defined in\r\n48\r\nC.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of \"commercial computer software\"\r\nand \"commercial computer software documentation,\"..\/ as such terms are\r\nused in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R.\r\n12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all\r\nU.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Code with only those rights\r\nset forth herein.\r\n\r\n11. MISCELLANEOUS.\r\n\r\nThis License represents the complete agreement concerning subject\r\nmatter hereof.

The application of the United Nations Convention on\r\nContracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded.\r\nAny law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract\r\nshall be construed against the drafter shall not apply to this\r\nLicense.\r\n\r\n12. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.\r\n\r\nAs between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is\r\nresponsible for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly,\r\nout of its utilization of rights under this License and You agree to\r\nwork with Initial Developer and Contributors to distribute such\r\nresponsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing herein is intended or\r\nshall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability.\r\n\r\n13. MULTIPLE-LICENSED CODE.\r\n\r\nInitial Developer may designate portions of the Covered Code as\r\n?Multiple-Licensed?. ?Multiple-Licensed? means that the Initial\r\nDeveloper permits you to utilize portions of the Covered Code under\r\nYour choice of the alternative licenses, if any, specified by the\r\nInitial Developer in the file described in Exhibit A.\r\n\r\nExhibit A -Sun Public License Notice.\r\n\r\nThe contents of this file are subject to the Sun Public License\r\n\r\nVersion 1.0 (the License); you may not use this file except in\r\n\r\ncompliance with the License.

Definitions\r\n\r\n\"Adaptation\" means a work based upon the Work, or upon the Work and other pre-existing works, such as a translation, adaptation, derivative work, arrangement of music or other alterations of a literary or artistic work, or phonogram or performance and includes cinematographic adaptations or any other form in which the Work may be recast, transformed, or adapted including in any form recognizably derived from the original, except that a work that constitutes a Collection will not be considered an Adaptation for the purpose of this License. For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a musical work, performance or phonogram, the synchronization of the Work in timed-relation with a moving image (\"synching\") will be considered an Adaptation for the purpose of this License.\r\n\"Collection\" means a collection of literary or artistic works, such as encyclopedias and anthologies, or performances, phonograms or broadcasts, or other works or subject matter other than works listed in Section 1(f) below, which, by reason of the selection and arrangement of their contents, constitute intellectual creations, in which the Work is included in its entirety in unmodified form along with one or more other contributions, each constituting separate and independent works in themselves, which together are assembled into a collective whole. A work that constitutes a Collection will not be considered an Adaptation (as defined below) for the purposes of this License.\r\n\"Creative Commons Compatible License\" means a license that is listed at http:\/\/creativecommons.org\/compatiblelicenses that has been approved by Creative Commons as being essentially equivalent to this License, including, at a minimum, because that license: (i) contains terms that have the same purpose, meaning and effect as the License Elements of this License; and, (ii) explicitly permits the relicensing of adaptations of works made available under that license under this License or a Creative Commons jurisdiction license with the same License Elements as this License.\r\n\"Distribute\" means to make available to the public the original and copies of the Work or Adaptation, as appropriate, through sale or other transfer of ownership.\r\n\"License Elements\" means the following high-level license attributes as selected by Licensor and indicated in the title of this License: Attribution, ShareAlike.\r\n\"Licensor\" means the individual, individuals, entity or entities that offer(s) the Work under the terms of this License.\r\n\"Original Author\" means, in the case of a literary or artistic work, the individual, individuals, entity or entities who created the Work or if no individual or entity can be identified, the publisher; and in addition (i) in the case of a performance the actors, singers, musicians, dancers, and other persons who act, sing, deliver, declaim, play in, interpret or otherwise perform literary or artistic works or expressions of folklore; (ii) in the case of a phonogram the producer being the person or legal entity who first fixes the sounds of a performance or other sounds; and, (iii) in the case of broadcasts, the organization that transmits the broadcast.\r\n\"Work\" means the literary and\/or artistic work offered under the terms of this License including without limitation any production in the literary, scientific and artistic domain, whatever may be the mode or form of its expression including digital form, such as a book, pamphlet and other writing; a lecture, address, sermon or other work of the same nature; a dramatic or dramatico-musical work; a choreographic work or entertainment in dumb show; a musical composition with or without words; a cinematographic work to which are assimilated works expressed by a process analogous to cinematography; a work of drawing, painting, architecture, sculpture, engraving or lithography; a photographic work to which are assimilated works expressed by a process analogous to photography; a work of applied art; an illustration, map, plan, sketch or three-dimensional work relative to geography, topography, architecture or science; a performance; a broadcast; a phonogram; a compilation of data to the extent it is protected as a copyrightable work; or a work performed by a variety or circus performer to the extent it is not otherwise considered a literary or artistic work.\r\n\"You\" means an individual or entity exercising rights under this License who has not previously violated the terms of this License with respect to the Work, or who has received express permission from the Licensor to exercise rights under this License despite a previous violation.\r\n\"Publicly Perform\" means to perform public recitations of the Work and to communicate to the public those public recitations, by any means or process, including by wire or wireless means or public digital performances; to make available to the public Works in such a way that members of the public may access these Works from a place and at a place individually chosen by them; to perform the Work to the public by any means or process and the communication to the public of the performances of the Work, including by public digital performance; to broadcast and rebroadcast the Work by any means including signs, sounds or images.\r\n\"Reproduce\" means to make copies of the Work by any means including without limitation by sound or visual recordings and the right of fixation and reproducing fixations of the Work, including storage of a protected performance or phonogram in digital form or other electronic medium.\r\n2. Fair Dealing Rights. Nothing in this License is intended to reduce, limit, or restrict any uses free from copyright or rights arising from limitations or exceptions that are provided for in connection with the copyright protection under copyright law or other applicable laws.\r\n\r\n3. License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright) license to exercise the rights in the Work as stated below:\r\n\r\nto Reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more Collections, and to Reproduce the Work as incorporated in the Collections;\r\nto create and Reproduce Adaptations provided that any such Adaptation, including any translation in any medium, takes reasonable steps to clearly label, demarcate or otherwise identify that changes were made to the original Work. For example, a translation could be marked \"The original work was translated from English to Spanish,\" or a modification could indicate \"The original work has been modified.\";\r\nto Distribute and Publicly Perform the Work including as incorporated in Collections; and,\r\nto Distribute and Publicly Perform Adaptations.\r\nFor the avoidance of doubt:\r\n\r\nNon-waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme cannot be waived, the Licensor reserves the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License;\r\nWaivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme can be waived, the Licensor waives the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License; and,\r\nVoluntary License Schemes. The Licensor waives the right to collect royalties, whether individually or, in the event that the Licensor is a member of a collecting society that administers voluntary licensing schemes, via that society, from any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License.\r\nThe above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now known or hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make such modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights in other media and formats. Subject to Section 8(f), all rights not expressly granted by Licensor are hereby reserved.\r\n\r\n4. Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made subject to and limited by the following restrictions:\r\n\r\nYou may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work only under the terms of this License. You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) for, this License with every copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on the Work that restrict the terms of this License or the ability of the recipient of the Work to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the License. You may not sublicense the Work. You must keep intact all notices that refer to this License and to the disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. When You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work, You may not impose any effective technological measures on the Work that restrict the ability of a recipient of the Work from You to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the License. This Section 4(a) applies to the Work as incorporated in a Collection, but this does not require the Collection apart from the Work itself to be made subject to the terms of this License. If You create a Collection, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Collection any credit as required by Section 4(c), as requested. If You create an Adaptation, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Adaptation any credit as required by Section 4(c), as requested.\r\nYou may Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation only under the terms of: (i) this License; (ii) a later version of this License with the same License Elements as this License; (iii) a Creative Commons jurisdiction license (either this or a later license version) that contains the same License Elements as this License (e.g., Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 US)); (iv) a Creative Commons Compatible License. If you license the Adaptation under one of the licenses mentioned in (iv), you must comply with the terms of that license. If you license the Adaptation under the terms of any of the licenses mentioned in (i), (ii) or (iii) (the \"Applicable License\"), you must comply with the terms of the Applicable License generally and the following provisions: (I) You must include a copy of, or the URI for, the Applicable License with every copy of each Adaptation You Distribute or Publicly Perform; (II) You may not offer or impose any terms on the Adaptation that restrict the terms of the Applicable License or the ability of the recipient of the Adaptation to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the Applicable License; (III) You must keep intact all notices that refer to the Applicable License and to the disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work as included in the Adaptation You Distribute or Publicly Perform; (IV) when You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Adaptation, You may not impose any effective technological measures on the Adaptation that restrict the ability of a recipient of the Adaptation from You to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the Applicable License. This Section 4(b) applies to the Adaptation as incorporated in a Collection, but this does not require the Collection apart from the Adaptation itself to be made subject to the terms of the Applicable License.\r\nIf You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or any Adaptations or Collections, You must, unless a request has been made pursuant to Section 4(a), keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and provide, reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing: (i) the name of the Original Author (or pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied, and\/or if the Original Author and\/or Licensor designate another party or parties (e.g., a sponsor institute, publishing entity, journal) for attribution (\"Attribution Parties\") in Licensor's copyright notice, terms of service or by other reasonable means, the name of such party or parties; (ii) the title of the Work if supplied; (iii) to the extent reasonably practicable, the URI, if any, that Licensor specifies to be associated with the Work, unless such URI does not refer to the copyright notice or licensing information for the Work; and (iv) , consistent with Ssection 3(b), in the case of an Adaptation, a credit identifying the use of the Work in the Adaptation (e.g., \"French translation of the Work by Original Author,\" or \"Screenplay based on original Work by Original Author\"). The credit required by this Section 4(c) may be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however, that in the case of a Adaptation or Collection, at a minimum such credit will appear, if a credit for all contributing authors of the Adaptation or Collection appears, then as part of these credits and in a manner at least as prominent as the credits for the other contributing authors. For the avoidance of doubt, You may only use the credit required by this Section for the purpose of attribution in the manner set out above and, by exercising Your rights under this License, You may not implicitly or explicitly assert or imply any connection with, sponsorship or endorsement by the Original Author, Licensor and\/or Attribution Parties, as appropriate, of You or Your use of the Work, without the separate, express prior written permission of the Original Author, Licensor and\/or Attribution Parties.\r\nExcept as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor or as may be otherwise permitted by applicable law, if You Reproduce, Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work either by itself or as part of any Adaptations or Collections, You must not distort, mutilate, modify or take other derogatory action in relation to the Work which would be prejudicial to the Original Author's honor or reputation. Licensor agrees that in those jurisdictions (e.g. Japan), in which any exercise of the right granted in Section 3(b) of this License (the right to make Adaptations) would be deemed to be a distortion, mutilation, modification or other derogatory action prejudicial to the Original Author's honor and reputation, the Licensor will waive or not assert, as appropriate, this Section, to the fullest extent permitted by the applicable national law, to enable You to reasonably exercise Your right under Section 3(b) of this License (right to make Adaptations) but not otherwise.\r\n5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer\r\n\r\nUNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\r\n\r\n6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\r\n\r\n7. Termination\r\n\r\nThis License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this License. Individuals or entities who have received Adaptations or Collections from You under this License, however, will not have their licenses terminated provided such individuals or entities remain in full compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any termination of this License.\r\nSubject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work). Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the Work under different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time; provided, however that any such election will not serve to withdraw this License (or any other license that has been, or is required to be, granted under the terms of this License), and this License will continue in full force and effect unless terminated as stated above.\r\n8. Miscellaneous\r\n\r\nEach time You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work or a Collection, the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.\r\nEach time You Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation, Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the original Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.\r\nIf any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this License, and without further action by the parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.\r\nNo term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or consent.\r\nThis License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings, agreements or representations with respect to the Work not specified here. Licensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions that may appear in any communication from You. This License may not be modified without the mutual written agreement of the Licensor and You.\r\nThe rights granted under, and the subject matter referenced, in this License were drafted utilizing the terminology of the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (as amended on September 28, 1979), the Rome Convention of 1961, the WIPO Copyright Treaty of 1996, the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty of 1996 and the Universal Copyright Convention (as revised on July 24, 1971). These rights and subject matter take effect in the relevant jurisdiction in which the License terms are sought to be enforced according to the corresponding provisions of the implementation of those treaty provisions in the applicable national law. If the standard suite of rights granted under applicable copyright law includes additional rights not granted under this License, such additional rights are deemed to be included in the License; this License is not intended to restrict the license of any rights under applicable law.\r\nCreative Commons Notice\r\n\r\nCreative Commons is not a party to this License, and makes no warranty whatsoever in connection with the Work. Creative Commons will not be liable to You or any party on any legal theory for any damages whatsoever, including without limitation any general, special, incidental or consequential damages arising in connection to this license. Notwithstanding the foregoing two (2) sentences, if Creative Commons has expressly identified itself as the Licensor hereunder, it shall have all rights and obligations of Licensor.\r\n\r\nExcept for the limited purpose of indicating to the public that the Work is licensed under the CCPL, Creative Commons does not authorize the use by either party of the trademark \"Creative Commons\" or any related trademark or logo of Creative Commons without the prior written consent of Creative Commons. Any permitted use will be in compliance with Creative Commons' then-current trademark usage guidelines, as may be published on its website or otherwise made available upon request from time to time. For the avoidance of doubt, this trademark restriction does not form part of the License.\r\n\r\nCreative Commons may be contacted at http:\/\/creativecommons.org\/.",

In this respect, the Licensee's\r\nattention has been drawn to the risks associated with loading, using,\r\nmodifying and\/or developing and reproducing the Software which are\r\nreserved for experienced users.\r\n\r\nThe Licensee shall be responsible for verifying, by any or all means,\r\nthe suitability of the product for its requirements, its good working\r\norder, and for ensuring that it shall not cause damage to either persons\r\nor properties.\r\n\r\n9.2 The Licensor hereby represents, in good faith, that it is entitled\r\nto grant all the rights over the Software (including in particular the\r\nrights set forth in Article 5).\r\n\r\n9.3 The Licensee acknowledges that the Software is supplied \"as is\" by\r\nthe Licensor without any other express or tacit warranty, other than\r\nthat provided for in Article 9.2 and, in particular, without any warranty \r\nas to its commercial value, its secured, safe, innovative or relevant\r\nnature.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, the Licensor does not warrant that the Software is free\r\nfrom any error, that it will operate without interruption, that it will\r\nbe compatible with the Licensee's own equipment and software\r\nconfiguration, nor that it will meet the Licensee's requirements.\r\n\r\n9.4 The Licensor does not either expressly or tacitly warrant that the\r\nSoftware does not infringe any third party intellectual property right\r\nrelating to a patent, software or any other property right. Therefore,\r\nthe Licensor disclaims any and all liability towards the Licensee\r\narising out of any or all proceedings for infringement that may be\r\ninstituted in respect of the use, modification and redistribution of the\r\nSoftware. Nevertheless, should such proceedings be instituted against\r\nthe Licensee, the Licensor shall provide it with technical and legal\r\nassistance for its defense. Such technical and legal assistance shall be\r\ndecided on a case-by-case basis between the relevant Licensor and the\r\nLicensee pursuant to a memorandum of understanding. The Licensor\r\ndisclaims any and all liability as regards the Licensee's use of the\r\nname of the Software.

Nothing in this License shall be deemed to \r\ngrant any rights to trademarks, copyrights, patents, trade secrets or any \r\nother intellectual property of Licensor except as expressly stated herein.

Nothing in this License shall be interpreted to prohibit \r\nLicensor from licensing under different terms from this License any Original \r\nWork that Licensor otherwise would have a right to license.\r\n\r\n5) External Deployment. The term \"External Deployment\" means the use or \r\ndistribution of the Original Work or Derivative Works in any way such that the \r\nOriginal Work or Derivative Works may be used by anyone other than You, \r\nwhether the Original Work or Derivative Works are distributed to those persons \r\nor made available as an application intended for use over a computer network. \r\nAs an express condition for the grants of license hereunder, You agree that \r\nany External Deployment by You of a Derivative Work shall be deemed a \r\ndistribution and shall be licensed to all under the terms of this License, as \r\nprescribed in section 1(c) herein.\r\n\r\n6) Attribution Rights. You must retain, in the Source Code of any Derivative \r\nWorks that You create, all copyright, patent or trademark notices from the \r\nSource Code of the Original Work, as well as any notices of licensing and any \r\ndescriptive text identified therein as an \"Attribution Notice.\" You must cause \r\nthe Source Code for any Derivative Works that You create to carry a prominent \r\nAttribution Notice reasonably calculated to inform recipients that You have \r\nmodified the Original Work.\r\n\r\n7) Warranty and Disclaimer of Warranty.

Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, \r\nwhether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall the \r\nLicensor be liable to any person for any direct, indirect, special, incidental, \r\nor consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this License \r\nor the use of the Original Work including, without limitation, damages for \r\nloss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and \r\nall other commercial damages or losses. This limitation of liability shall not \r\napply to liability for death or personal injury resulting from Licensor's \r\nnegligence to the extent applicable law prohibits such limitation. Some \r\njurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or \r\nconsequential damages, so this exclusion and limitation may not apply to You.\r\n\r\n9) Acceptance and Termination. If You distribute copies of the Original Work \r\nor a Derivative Work, You must make a reasonable effort under the circumstances \r\nto obtain the express and volitional assent of recipients to the terms of this \r\nLicense.

Therefore, by exercising any of the rights granted to You in Sections \r\n1 herein, You indicate Your acceptance of this License and all of its terms and \r\nconditions. This License shall terminate immediately and you may no longer \r\nexercise any of the rights granted to You by this License upon Your failure to \r\nhonor the proviso in Section 1(c) herein.\r\n\r\n10) Mutual Termination for Patent Action. This License shall terminate \r\nautomatically and You may no longer exercise any of the rights granted to You \r\nby this License if You file a lawsuit in any court alleging that any OSI \r\nCertified open source software that is licensed under any license containing \r\nthis \"Mutual Termination for Patent Action\" clause infringes any patent claims \r\nthat are essential to use that software.\r\n\r\n11) Jurisdiction, Venue and Governing Law. Any action or suit relating to this \r\nLicense may be brought only in the courts of a jurisdiction wherein the Licensor \r\nresides or in which Licensor conducts its primary business, and under the laws \r\nof that jurisdiction excluding its conflict-of-law provisions. The application \r\nof the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of \r\nGoods is expressly excluded. Any use of the Original Work outside the scope of \r\nthis License or after its termination shall be subject to the requirements and \r\npenalties of the U.S. Copyright Act, 17 U.S.C. \u00e5\u00a4 101 et seq., the equivalent \r\nlaws of other countries, and international treaty. This section shall survive \r\nthe termination of this License.\r\n\r\n12) Attorneys Fees.

This section shall survive the termination of this \r\nLicense.\r\n\r\n13) Miscellaneous. This License represents the complete agreement concerning \r\nthe subject matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be \r\nunenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary \r\nto make it enforceable.\r\n\r\n14) Definition of \"You\" in This License. \"You\" throughout this License, \r\nwhether in upper or lower case, means an individual or a legal entity exercising \r\nrights under, and complying with all of the terms of, this License.

You must retain, in the Source Code of any Derivative Works that You create, all copyright, patent or trademark notices from the Source Code of the Original Work, as well as any notices of licensing and any descriptive text identified therein as an \"Attribution Notice.\" You must cause the Source Code for any Derivative Works that You create to carry a prominent Attribution Notice reasonably calculated to inform recipients that You have modified the Original Work.\r\n\r\n7) Warranty of Provenance and Disclaimer of Warranty. Licensor warrants that the copyright in and to the Original Work and the patent rights granted herein by Licensor are owned by the Licensor or are sublicensed to You under the terms of this License with the permission of the contributor(s) of those copyrights and patent rights. Except as expressly stated in the immediately proceeding sentence, the Original Work is provided under this License on an \"AS IS\" BASIS and WITHOUT WARRANTY, either express or implied, including, without limitation, the warranties of NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY OF THE ORIGINAL WORK IS WITH YOU. This DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY constitutes an essential part of this License. No license to Original Work is granted hereunder except under this disclaimer.\r\n\r\n8) Limitation of Liability. Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall the Licensor be liable to any person for any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this License or the use of the Original Work including, without limitation, damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses. This limitation of liability shall not apply to liability for death or personal injury resulting from Licensor's negligence to the extent applicable law prohibits such limitation. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so this exclusion and limitation may not apply to You.\r\n\r\n9) Acceptance and Termination. If You distribute copies of the Original Work or a Derivative Work, You must make a reasonable effort under the circumstances to obtain the express assent of recipients to the terms of this License. Nothing else but this License (or another written agreement between Licensor and You) grants You permission to create Derivative Works based upon the Original Work or to exercise any of the rights granted in Section 1 herein, and any attempt to do so except under the terms of this License (or another written agreement between Licensor and You) is expressly prohibited by U.S. copyright law, the equivalent laws of other countries, and by international treaty. Therefore, by exercising any of the rights granted to You in Section 1 herein, You indicate Your acceptance of this License and all of its terms and conditions. This License shall terminate immediately and you may no longer exercise any of the rights granted to You by this License upon Your failure to honor the proviso in Section 1(c) herein.\r\n\r\n10) Termination for Patent Action. This License shall terminate automatically and You may no longer exercise any of the rights granted to You by this License as of the date You commence an action, including a cross-claim or counterclaim, against Licensor or any licensee alleging that the Original Work infringes a patent.

A plain version of the OSD without annotations can be found here.\r\n\r\nIntroduction\r\nOpen source doesn't just mean access to the source code. The distribution terms of open-source software must comply with the following criteria:\r\n\r\n1. Free Redistribution\r\nThe license shall not restrict any party from selling or giving away the software as a component of an aggregate software distribution containing programs from several different sources. The license shall not require a royalty or other fee for such sale.\r\n\r\nRationale: By constraining the license to require free redistribution, we eliminate the temptation to throw away many long-term gains in order to make a few short-term sales dollars. If we didn't do this, there would be lots of pressure for cooperators to defect.\r\n\r\n2. Source Code\r\nThe program must include source code, and must allow distribution in source code as well as compiled form. Where some form of a product is not distributed with source code, there must be a well-publicized means of obtaining the source code for no more than a reasonable reproduction cost preferably, downloading via the Internet without charge. The source code must be the preferred form in which a programmer would modify the program. Deliberately obfuscated source code is not allowed. Intermediate forms such as the output of a preprocessor or translator are not allowed.\r\n\r\nRationale: We require access to un-obfuscated source code because you can't evolve programs without modifying them. Since our purpose is to make evolution easy, we require that modification be made easy.\r\n\r\n3. Derived Works\r\nThe license must allow modifications and derived works, and must allow them to be distributed under the same terms as the license of the original software.\r\n\r\nRationale: The mere ability to read source isn't enough to support independent peer review and rapid evolutionary selection. For rapid evolution to happen, people need to be able to experiment with and redistribute modifications.\r\n\r\n4. Integrity of The Author's Source Code\r\nThe license may restrict source-code from being distributed in modified form only if the license allows the distribution of \"patch files\" with the source code for the purpose of modifying the program at build time. The license must explicitly permit distribution of software built from modified source code. The license may require derived works to carry a different name or version number from the original software.\r\n\r\nRationale: Encouraging lots of improvement is a good thing, but users have a right to know who is responsible for the software they are using. Authors and maintainers have reciprocal right to know what they're being asked to support and protect their reputations.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, an open-source license must guarantee that source be readily available, but may require that it be distributed as pristine base sources plus patches. In this way, \"unofficial\" changes can be made available but readily distinguished from the base source.\r\n\r\n5. No Discrimination Against Persons or Groups\r\nThe license must not discriminate against any person or group of persons.\r\n\r\nRationale: In order to get the maximum benefit from the process, the maximum diversity of persons and groups should be equally eligible to contribute to open sources. Therefore we forbid any open-source license from locking anybody out of the process.\r\n\r\nSome countries, including the United States, have export restrictions for certain types of software. An OSD-conformant license may warn licensees of applicable restrictions and remind them that they are obliged to obey the law; however, it may not incorporate such restrictions itself.\r\n\r\n6. No Discrimination Against Fields of Endeavor\r\nThe license must not restrict anyone from making use of the program in a specific field of endeavor. For example, it may not restrict the program from being used in a business, or from being used for genetic research.\r\n\r\nRationale: The major intention of this clause is to prohibit license traps that prevent open source from being used commercially. We want commercial users to join our community, not feel excluded from it.\r\n\r\n7. Distribution of License\r\nThe rights attached to the program must apply to all to whom the program is redistributed without the need for execution of an additional license by those parties.\r\n\r\nRationale: This clause is intended to forbid closing up software by indirect means such as requiring a non-disclosure agreement.\r\n\r\n8. License Must Not Be Specific to a Product\r\nThe rights attached to the program must not depend on the program's being part of a particular software distribution. If the program is extracted from that distribution and used or distributed within the terms of the program's license, all parties to whom the program is redistributed should have the same rights as those that are granted in conjunction with the original software distribution.\r\n\r\nRationale: This clause forecloses yet another class of license traps.\r\n\r\n9. License Must Not Restrict Other Software\r\nThe license must not place restrictions on other software that is distributed along with the licensed software. For example, the license must not insist that all other programs distributed on the same medium must be open-source software.\r\n\r\nRationale: Distributors of open-source software have the right to make their own choices about their own software.\r\n\r\nYes, the GPL is conformant with this requirement. Software linked with GPLed libraries only inherits the GPL if it forms a single work, not any software with which they are merely distributed.\r\n\r\n10. License Must Be Technology-Neutral\r\nNo provision of the license may be predicated on any individual technology or style of interface.\r\n\r\nRationale: This provision is aimed specifically at licenses which require an explicit gesture of assent in order to establish a contract between licensor and licensee. Provisions mandating so-called \"click-wrap\" may conflict with important methods of software distribution such as FTP download, CD-ROM anthologies, and web mirroring; such provisions may also hinder code re-use. Conformant licenses must allow for the possibility that (a) redistribution of the software will take place over non-Web channels that do not support click-wrapping of the download, and that (b) the covered code (or re-used portions of covered code) may run in a non-GUI environment that cannot support popup dialogues.",

HISTORY OF THE SOFTWARE\r\n==========================\r\n\r\nPython was created in the early 1990s by Guido van Rossum at Stichting\r\nMathematisch Centrum (CWI) in the Netherlands as a successor of a\r\nlanguage called ABC.  Guido is Python's principal author, although it\r\nincludes many contributions from others.  The last version released\r\nfrom CWI was Python 1.2.  In 1995, Guido continued his work on Python\r\nat the Corporation for National Research Initiatives (CNRI) in Reston,\r\nVirginia where he released several versions of the software.  Python\r\n1.6 was the last of the versions released by CNRI.  In 2000, Guido and\r\nthe Python core development team moved to BeOpen.com to form the\r\nBeOpen PythonLabs team.  Python 2.0 was the first and only release\r\nfrom BeOpen.com.\r\n\r\nFollowing the release of Python 1.6, and after Guido van Rossum left\r\nCNRI to work with commercial software developers, it became clear that\r\nthe ability to use Python with software available under the GNU Public\r\nLicense (GPL) was very desirable.  CNRI and the Free Software\r\nFoundation (FSF) interacted to develop enabling wording changes to the\r\nPython license.  Python 1.6.1 is essentially the same as Python 1.6,\r\nwith a few minor bug fixes, and with a different license that enables\r\nlater versions to be GPL-compatible.  Python 2.0.1 is a derivative work\r\nof Python 1.6.1, as well as of Python 2.0.\r\n\r\nAfter Python 2.0 was released by BeOpen.com, Guido van Rossum and the\r\nother PythonLabs developers joined Digital Creations.  All\r\nintellectual property added from this point on, including Python\r\n2.0.1 and its alpha and beta releases, is owned by the Python Software\r\nFoundation (PSF), a non-profit modeled after the Apache Software\r\nFoundation.  See http:\/\/www.python.org\/psf\/ for more information about\r\nthe PSF.\r\n\r\nThanks to the many outside volunteers who have worked under Guido's\r\ndirection to make these releases possible.\r\n\r\n\r\nB.

BY USING RED HAT SOFTWARE OR SERVICES, CLIENT SIGNIFIES ITS ASSENT TO AND ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT AND ACKNOWLEDGES IT HAS READ AND UNDERSTANDS THIS AGREEMENT. AN INDIVIDUAL ACTING ON BEHALF OF AN ENTITY REPRESENTS THAT HE OR SHE HAS THE AUTHORITY TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT ON BEHALF OF THAT ENTITY. IF CLIENT DOES NOT ACCEPT THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT, THEN IT MUST NOT USE RED HAT SOFTWARE OR SERVICES. This Agreement incorporates those appendices at the end of this Agreement.\r\n\r\nThis Red Hat Enterprise Agreement, including all referenced appendices and documents located at URLs (the \"Agreement\"), is between Red Hat, Inc. (\"Red Hat\") and the purchaser or user of Red Hat software and services who accepts the terms of this Agreement (\"Client\"). The effective date of this Agreement (\"Effective Date\") is the earlier of the date that Client signs or accepts this Agreement or the date that Client uses Red Hat's software or services.\r\n\r\nScope of Agreement\r\n1.1\tFramework. This Agreement establishes a framework that will enable Red Hat to provide Software and Services to Client. \"Software\" means Red Hat Enterprise Linux, JBoss Enterprise Middleware and other software programs branded by Red Hat, its Affiliates and\/or third parties including all modifications, additions or further enhancements delivered by Red Hat. The specific services (the \"Services\") and\/or Software that Red Hat will provide to Client will be described in an Order Form, signed by the parties or otherwise accepted by Red Hat, which may consist of (a) one or more mutually agreed order forms, statements of work, work orders or similar transaction documents, or (b) an order placed by Client through Red Hat's online store accessible from a Red Hat website. The parties agree that the terms of this Agreement will govern all purchases and use by Client of Software and Services unless otherwise agreed by the parties in writing.\r\n\r\n1.2\tAffiliates. Red Hat and Client agree that Affiliates of Client may acquire Software and Services from Red Hat or its Affiliates by entering an Order Form with Red Hat (or a Red Hat Affiliate) that incorporates the terms and conditions of this Agreement. The parties acknowledge that adjustments to the terms of this Agreement may be made in a particular Order Form (for example, to address disparate tax and\/or legal regimes in other geographic regions). \"Affiliate\" means an entity that owns or controls, is owned or controlled by, or is under common control or ownership with a party, where \"control\" is the possession, direct or indirect, of the power to direct or cause the direction of the management and policies of an entity, whether through ownership of voting securities, by contract or otherwise.\r\n\r\n1.3\tBusiness Partners. Red Hat has entered into agreements with other organizations (\"Business Partners\") to promote, market and support certain Software and Services. When Client purchases Software and Services through a Business Partner, Red Hat confirms that it is responsible for providing the Software and Services to Client under the terms of this Agreement. Red Hat is not responsible for (a) the actions of Business Partners, (b) any additional obligations Business Partners have to Client, or (c) any products or services that Business Partners supply to Client under any separate agreements between a Business Partner and Client.\r\n\r\nObligations of the Parties\r\n2.1\tOn-Site Obligations. If Red Hat personnel are working on Client's premises (a) Client will provide a safe and secure working environment for Red Hat personnel, and (b) Red Hat will comply with all reasonable workplace safety and security standards and policies, applicable to Client's employees, of which Red Hat is notified in writing by Client in advance.\r\n\r\n2.2\tChanges to Work and Delays. Changes to the Services will be made only through a written change order signed by both parties. In the event that (a) Client fails to timely fulfill its obligations under an Order Form, and this failure adversely impacts the provision of Services, or (b) events outside of either party's reasonable control cause a delay in or otherwise affect Red Hat's ability to perform its obligations under an Order Form, Red Hat will be entitled to appropriate relief, including adjusting the timing of its delivery of applicable Services.\r\n\r\n2.3\tAssistance. Client may provide Red Hat access to Client information, systems, and software (\"Client Information\"), and resources such as workspace, network access, and telephone connections as reasonably required by Red Hat in order to provide the Services. Client understands and agrees that (a) the completeness, accuracy of, and extent of access to, any Client Information provided to Red Hat may affect Red Hat's ability to provide Services, and (b) if reasonable access to Client Information is not provided, Red Hat will be relieved from providing any Services dependent upon such access. Client will obtain any third party consents necessary to grant Red Hat access to the Client Information that is subject to the proprietary rights of, or controlled by, any third party, or which is subject to any other form of restriction upon disclosure.\r\n\r\nPayment\r\n3.1\tFees and Expenses. Fees for the Services (the \"Fees\") will be identified in an Order Form and are (a) due upon Red Hat's acceptance of an Order Form or, for renewal of Services, at the start of the renewal term, and (b) payable in accordance with Section 3.2. Fees are stated in United States Dollars, must be paid in United States Dollars, and, unless otherwise specified in writing, do not include out-of-pocket expenses or shipping costs. Client will reimburse Red Hat for all reasonable expenses Red Hat incurs in connection with the performance of Services. Client agrees to pay Red Hat the applicable Fees for each Unit. \"Unit\" is the measurement of Software or Service usage defined in the applicable Order Form. Any renewal of Subscription Services will be at the same price per Unit listed in the applicable Order Form. \"Subscription Services\" mean fee-bearing subscriptions for a defined period of time for a certain scope of Services.\r\n\r\n3.2\tInvoices\r\n3.2.1 If Client desires credit terms with respect to the payment of Fees, Client will reasonably cooperate with Red Hat in establishing and periodically re-confirming Client's credit-worthiness. If credit terms are provided to Client, Red Hat will invoice Client for the Fees upon Red Hat's acceptance of the applicable Order Form and upon acceptance of any future order. Unless otherwise specified in an Order Form and subject to Red Hat's approval of credit terms, Client will pay Fees and expenses, if any, no later than thirty (30) days from the date of each invoice; provided, however, that Fees for professional services, training, training credits and other service credits are due prior to delivery. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, any and all payments made by Client pursuant to this Agreement are non-refundable. Red Hat reserves the right to suspend or cancel performance of all or part of the Services and\/or change its credit terms if actual payment has not been received within thirty (30) days of the invoice date.\r\n\r\n3.2.2\tIf Client is paying by credit card, Client (a) authorizes Red Hat to charge Client's credit card for the Services and for the amount due at the time of renewal of Subscription Services, and (b) agrees to provide updated credit card information to Red Hat for renewal purposes.\r\n\r\n3.3\tTaxes. All Fees are exclusive of Taxes. Client will pay Red Hat an amount equal to any Taxes arising from or relating to this Agreement or an applicable Order Form which are paid by or are payable by Red Hat. \"Taxes\" means any form of sales, use, value added or other form of taxation and any fines, penalties, surcharges or interest, but excluding any taxes based solely on the net income of Red Hat. If Client is required to withhold or deduct any portion of the payments due to Red Hat, Client will increase the sum payable to Red Hat by the amount necessary so that Red Hat receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had Client made no withholdings or deductions.\r\n\r\nLicense and Ownership\r\n4.1\tSoftware. Each type of Software is governed by a license grant or an end user license agreement, which license terms are contained or referenced in the appendices to this Agreement or the applicable Order Form.\r\n\r\n4.2\tFreedom to Use Ideas. Subject to Section 9 and Client's rights in Client Information and notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement or an Order Form, the ideas, methods, concepts, know-how, structures, techniques, inventions, developments, processes, discoveries, improvements and other information and materials developed in and during the course of any Order Form may be used by Red Hat, without an obligation to account, in any way Red Hat deems appropriate, including by or for itself or its clients or customers.\r\n\r\n4.3\tMarks. Unless expressly stated in an Order Form, no right or license, express or implied, is granted in this Agreement for the use of any Red Hat, Red Hat Affiliate, Client or third party trade names, service marks or trademarks, including, without limitation, the distribution of the Software utilizing any Red Hat or Red Hat Affiliate trademarks.\r\n\r\nReporting and Inspection\r\n5.1\tReporting. Client will notify Red Hat (or the Business Partner from whom Client purchased Software or Services) promptly if the actual number of Units of Software or Services utilized by Client exceeds the number of Units for which Client has paid the applicable Fees. In its notice, Client will include the number of additional Units and the date(s) on which such Units were first utilized. Red Hat (or the Business Partner) will invoice Client for the applicable Services for such Units and Client will pay for such Services no later than thirty (30) days from the date of the invoice.\r\n\r\n5.2\tInspection. During the term of this Agreement and for one (1) year thereafter, Red Hat or its designated agent may inspect Client's facilities and records to verify Client's compliance with this Agreement. Any such inspection will take place only during Client's normal business hours and upon no less than ten (10) days prior written notice from Red Hat. Red Hat will give Client written notice of any noncompliance, including the number of underreported Units of Software or Services, and Client will have fifteen (15) days from the date of this notice to make payment to Red Hat for the applicable Services provided with respect to the underreported Units. If Client underreports the number of Units utilized by more than five percent (5%) of the number of Units for which Client paid, Client will also pay Red Hat for the cost of such inspection.\r\n\r\nTerm and Termination\r\n6.1\tTerm and Termination of Agreement. The term of this Agreement will begin on the Effective Date and will terminate at the expiration of ninety (90) days following written notice of termination given by one party to the other. Termination of this Agreement will not operate to terminate any Order Form and the terms and conditions of this Agreement will continue in full force and effect to the extent necessary to give effect to any Order Form in effect at the time of termination of this Agreement and until such time as the applicable Order Form expires or is terminated in accordance with Section 6.2 below.\r\n\r\n6.2\tTerm and Termination of Order Form\r\n6.2.1\tThe term of an Order Form begins on the date the Order Form is executed (\"Order Form Effective Date\") and continues for the term stated in the Order Form. Thereafter, the term for Subscription Services will automatically renew for successive terms of one (1) year each, unless either party gives written notice to the other of its intention not to renew at least sixty (60) days before the commencement of the next renewal term. Client must use any other Services set forth in an Order Form during the term specified in the Order Form or within one (1) year of the Order Form Effective Date, whichever is shorter; if unused, such Services will be forfeited.\r\n\r\n6.2.2\tIf Client or Red Hat materially breaches the terms of an Order Form, and such breach is not cured within thirty (30) days after written notice of the breach is given to the breaching party, then the other party may, by giving written notice of termination to the breaching party, terminate the applicable Order Form and\/or this Agreement; provided, however, that no cure period will be required for a breach of Section 9 of this Agreement. The termination of an individual Order Form will not terminate any other Order Form or this Agreement unless otherwise specified in the written notice of termination. Without prejudice to any other right or remedy of Red Hat, in the event either party terminates an Order Form, Client will pay Red Hat (or the Business Partner from whom Client purchased such Software or Services) for all Services provided up to the effective date of termination.\r\n\r\n6.3\tSurvival. If this Agreement or an Order Form is terminated for any reason, Sections 3, 4, 5.2, 6.3, 7, 8, 9, 10.2, 12, 13.1, 13.5-13.14, and 14 of this Agreement (as the same are incorporated into each Order Form) will survive such termination.\r\n\r\nContinuing Business\r\nNothing in this Agreement will preclude or limit Red Hat from providing software, materials, or services for itself or other clients, irrespective of the possible similarity of such software, materials or services to those that might be delivered to Client. The terms of confidentiality in Section 9 will not prohibit or restrict either party's right to develop, use or market products or services similar to or competitive with the other party; provided, however, that neither party is relieved of its obligations under this Agreement.\r\n\r\nLimitation of Liability and Disclaimer of Damages\r\n8.1\tLimitation of Liability. FOR ALL EVENTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES, RED HAT AND ITS AFFILIATES' AGGREGATE AND CUMULATIVE LIABILITY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT AND ALL ORDER FORMS, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION ON ACCOUNT OF PERFORMANCE OR NON-PERFORMANCE OF OBLIGATIONS, REGARDLESS OF THE FORM OF THE CAUSE OF ACTION, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, NEGLIGENCE), STATUTE OR OTHERWISE WILL BE LIMITED TO DIRECT DAMAGES AND WILL NOT EXCEED THE AMOUNTS RECEIVED BY RED HAT DURING TWELVE (12) MONTHS IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING THE FIRST EVENT GIVING RISE TO LIABILITY, WITH RESPECT TO THE PARTICULAR ITEMS (WHETHER SOFTWARE, SERVICES OR OTHERWISE) GIVING RISE TO LIABILITY UNDER THE MOST APPLICABLE ORDERING DOCUMENT.\r\n\r\n8.2\tDisclaimer of Damages. NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY CONTAINED IN THIS AGREEMENT OR AN ORDER FORM, IN NO EVENT WILL RED HAT OR ITS AFFILIATES BE LIABLE TO CLIENT OR ITS AFFILIATES FOR DAMAGES OTHER THAN DIRECT DAMAGES, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION: ANY INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, SPECIAL, INDIRECT, EXEMPLARY OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, WHETHER ARISING IN TORT, CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE; OR ANY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH ANY MALFUNCTIONS, REGULATORY NON-COMPLIANCE, DELAYS, LOSS OF DATA, LOST PROFITS, LOST SAVINGS, INTERRUPTION OF SERVICE, LOSS OF BUSINESS OR ANTICIPATORY PROFITS, EVEN IF RED HAT OR ITS AFFILIATES HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. LIABILITY FOR THESE DAMAGES WILL BE LIMITED AND EXCLUDED EVEN IF ANY EXCLUSIVE REMEDY PROVIDED FOR IN THIS AGREEMENT FAILS OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE.\r\n\r\nConfidentiality\r\n9.1\tObligations. During the term of this Agreement, both parties agree that (i) Confidential Information will be used only in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; (ii) each will use the same degree of care it utilizes to protect its own confidential information, but in no event less than reasonable care; and (iii) the Confidential Information may be disclosed only to employees, agents and contractors with a need to know, and to its auditors and legal counsel, in each case, who are under a written obligation to keep such information confidential using standards of confidentiality not less restrictive than those required by this Agreement. Both parties agree that obligations of confidentiality will exist for a period of two (2) years following initial disclosure of the particular Confidential Information. \"Confidential Information\" means all information disclosed by either Red Hat or Client (\"Disclosing Party\") to the other party (\"Recipient\") during the term of this Agreement that is either (i) marked confidential or (ii) disclosed orally and described as confidential at the time of disclosure and subsequently set forth in writing, marked confidential, and sent to the Recipient within thirty (30) days following the oral disclosure.\r\n\r\n9.2\tExclusions. Confidential Information will not include information which: (i) is or later becomes publicly available without breach of this Agreement, or is disclosed by the Disclosing Party without obligation of confidentiality; (ii) is known to the Recipient at the time of disclosure by the Disclosing Party; (iii) is independently developed by the Recipient without use of the Confidential Information; (iv) becomes lawfully known or available to the Recipient without restriction from a source having the lawful right to disclose the information; (v) is generally known or easily ascertainable by parties of ordinary skill in the business of the Recipient; or (vi) is software code in either object code or source code form that is licensed under an open source license. The Recipient will not be prohibited from complying with disclosure mandated by applicable law if, where reasonably practicable and without breaching any legal or regulatory requirement, it gives the Disclosing Party advance notice of the disclosure requirement.\r\n\r\nRepresentations and Warranties\r\n10.1\tGeneral Representations and Warranties. Red Hat represents and warrants that: (a) the Services will be performed in a professional and workmanlike manner by qualified personnel; (b) it has the authority to enter into this Agreement with Client; and (c) to Red Hat's knowledge, Red Hat branded Software does not, at the time of delivery to Client, include malicious or hidden mechanisms or code for the purpose of damaging or corrupting the Software.\r\n\r\n10.2\tDisclaimer of Warranty. EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY PROVIDED IN SECTION 10.1 OR BY A THIRD PARTY VENDOR DIRECTLY TO CLIENT UNDER A SEPARATE AGREEMENT, THE SERVICES, SOFTWARE AND ANY HARDWARE ARE PROVIDED BY RED HAT \"AS IS\" AND WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, INCLUDING THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, NON-INFRINGEMENT, AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. RED HAT DOES NOT GUARANTEE OR WARRANT THAT THE USE OF THE SERVICES, SOFTWARE OR HARDWARE WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED, COMPLY WITH REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS, BE ERROR FREE OR THAT RED HAT WILL CORRECT ALL SOFTWARE ERRORS. FOR THE BREACH OF THE WARRANTIES SET FORTH IN SECTION 10.1, CLIENT'S EXCLUSIVE REMEDY, AND RED HAT'S ENTIRE LIABILITY, WILL BE THE REPERFORMANCE OF DEFICIENT SERVICES, OR IF RED HAT CANNOT SUBSTANTIALLY CORRECT A BREACH IN A COMMERCIALLY REASONABLE MANNER, CLIENT MAY TERMINATE THE RELEVANT SERVICES AND RECEIVE A PRO RATA REFUND OF THE FEES PAID FOR THE DEFICIENT SERVICES AS OF THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF TERMINATION. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing disclaimer, the Software, Services and any hardware provided are not specifically designed, manufactured or intended for use in (a) the planning, construction, maintenance, control, or direct operation of nuclear facilities, (b) aircraft navigation, control or communication systems, weapons systems, or (c) direct life support systems. Client agrees that it is solely responsible for the results obtained from the use of the Software and Services.\r\n\r\nOpen Source Assurance Program\r\nFor Software that is Red Hat branded, purchases under this Agreement may entitle Client to participate in Red Hat's Open Source Assurance Program which is described at http:\/\/www.redhat.com\/rhel\/details\/assurance\/. The terms for this optional program are subject to a separate agreement which can be viewed at http:\/\/www.redhat.com\/legal\/open_source_assurance_agreement.html.\r\n\r\nGoverning Law\/Consent to Jurisdiction\r\nThe validity, interpretation and enforcement of this Agreement will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the United States and of the State of New York without giving effect to the conflicts of laws provisions thereof or the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods. All disputes arising out of or relating to this Agreement will be submitted to the exclusive jurisdiction of the state or federal courts of competent jurisdiction located in Raleigh, North Carolina, and each party irrevocably consents to such personal jurisdiction and waives all objections to this venue. In the event the Uniform Computer Information Transactions Act (UCITA) or any similar federal or state laws or regulations are enacted, it will not apply to this Agreement, and the governing law will remain as if such law or regulation had not been enacted.\r\n\r\nMiscellaneous\r\n13.1\tNotices. Notices must be in English, in writing, and will be deemed given when delivered by hand or five (5) days after being sent using a method that provides for positive confirmation of delivery to the respective addresses or facsimile numbers indicated in an Order Form; provided that any notice from Client to Red Hat includes a copy sent to: Red Hat, Inc., Attention: General Counsel, 1801 Varsity Drive, Raleigh, North Carolina 27606; Facsimile: (919) 754-3704.\r\n\r\n13.2\tAssignment. This Agreement is binding on the parties to this Agreement, and other than the rights conferred on Business Partners in Sections 5.1 and 6.2.2, nothing in this Agreement or in any Order Form grants any other person or entity any right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever, except for the parties' Affiliates as expressly provided in this Agreement. This Agreement is assignable by either party only with the other party's prior written consent, which will not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed; provided, however, either party may, upon written notice and without the prior approval of the other party, (a) assign this Agreement to an Affiliate as long as the Affiliate has sufficient credit to satisfy its obligations under this Agreement and the scope of Service is not affected; and (b) assign this Agreement pursuant to a merger or a sale of all or substantially all of such party's assets or stock.\r\n\r\n13.3\tIndependent Contractor. Red Hat is an independent contractor and nothing in this Agreement or related to Red Hat's performance of any Order Form will be construed to create an employment or agency relationship between Client (or any Client personnel) and Red Hat (or any Red Hat personnel). Each party will be solely responsible for supervision, direction, control and payment of its personnel, including applicable taxes, deductions, other payments and benefits. Red Hat may subcontract Services under an Order Form to third parties or Affiliates without the approval of Client; provided, however, that (a) subcontractors agree to protect Client Confidential Information, and (b) Red Hat remains responsible to Client for performance of its obligations hereunder.\r\n\r\n13.4\tForce Majeure. Neither party will be liable for nonperformance or delays caused by acts of God, wars, riots, strikes, fires, floods, hurricanes, earthquakes, government restrictions, terrorist acts or other causes beyond its reasonable control.\r\n\r\n13.5\tNon-solicitation. Client agrees not to solicit or hire any personnel of Red Hat involved with the delivery of Services in connection with any Order Form during the term of and for twelve (12) months after termination or expiration of such Order Form; provided that Client may hire an individual employed by Red Hat who, without other solicitation, responds to advertisements or solicitations aimed at the general public.\r\n\r\n13.6\tExport and Privacy. Red Hat may supply Client with technical data that is subject to export control restrictions. Red Hat will not be responsible for compliance by Client with applicable export obligations or requirements for this technical data. Client agrees to comply with all applicable export control restrictions. If Client breaches this Section 13.6 or the export provisions of an applicable end user license agreement for the Software, or any provision referencing these sections, Red Hat may terminate this Agreement and\/or the applicable Order Form and its obligations thereunder without liability to Client. Client acknowledges and agrees that to provide the Services, it may be necessary for Client Information to be transferred between Red Hat, its Affiliates, Business Partners, and\/or subcontractors, which may be located worldwide.\r\n\r\n13.7\tDispute Resolution. Each party agrees to give the other a written description of any problem(s) that may arise and to make a good faith effort to amicably resolve any such problem before commencing any proceeding. Notwithstanding the foregoing, either party may take any action reasonably required to protect such party's rights. No claim or action, regardless of form, arising out of this Agreement or an Order Form may be brought by either party more than one (1) year after the cause of action has accrued.\r\n\r\n13.8\tHeadings. All headings contained in this Agreement are inserted for identification and convenience and will not be deemed part of this Agreement for purposes of interpretation.\r\n\r\n13.9\tSeverability. If any provision of this Agreement is held invalid or unenforceable for any reason but would be valid and enforceable if appropriately modified, then such provision will apply with the modification necessary to make it valid and enforceable. If such provision cannot be so modified, the parties agree that such invalidity will not affect the validity of the remaining provisions of the Agreement.\r\n\r\n13.10\tWaiver. The delay or failure of either party to exercise any rights under this Agreement will not constitute or be deemed a waiver or forfeiture of such rights. No waiver will be valid unless in writing and signed by an authorized representative of the party against whom such waiver is sought to be enforced.\r\n\r\n13.11\tComplete Agreement. Each Order Form (a) is a separate agreement and is deemed to incorporate this Agreement, unless otherwise expressly provided in that Order Form; (b) constitutes the exclusive terms and conditions with respect to the subject matter of that Order Form, notwithstanding any different or additional terms that may be contained in the form of purchase order or other document used by Client to place orders or otherwise effect transactions under this Agreement; and (c) represents the final, complete and exclusive statement of the agreement between the parties with respect thereto, notwithstanding any prior written agreements or prior and contemporaneous oral agreements with respect to the subject matter of the Order Form. In the event of any conflict between this Agreement, any Order Form and any end user license agreement for Software, this Agreement will take precedence unless otherwise expressly provided in the Order Form. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in this Agreement, any applicable end user license agreement will be governed by the laws of the State of New York and of the United States, without regard to any conflict of laws provisions. Any claim relating to the provision of the Services by Red Hat, its Affiliates or their respective personnel will be made against Red Hat alone.\r\n\r\n13.12\tAmendment. Neither this Agreement nor any Order Form may be amended or modified except in a writing signed by the parties, which writing makes specific reference to this Agreement or the applicable Order Form.\r\n\r\n13.13\tCounterparts and Facsimile Signature. In the event this Agreement is executed with signatures, this Agreement may be executed in counterparts, each of which will be deemed an original and all of which will constitute one and the same document. The parties may exchange signature pages by facsimile and such signatures will be effective to bind the parties to all the terms contained in this Agreement.\r\n\r\n13.14\tUnited States Government End Users. The Software and its documentation are \"Commercial items,\" \"Commercial computer software\" and \"Computer software documentation\" as defined by the Federal Acquisition Regulations (\"FAR\") and Defense Federal Acquisition Regulations Supplement (\"DFARS\"). Pursuant to FAR 12.211, FAR 12.212, DFARS, 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4, and their successors, the U.S. Government acquires the Software and its documentation subject to the terms of this Agreement.\r\n\r\nWaiver of Jury Trial\r\nTO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, EACH PARTY WAIVES THE RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED UNDER THIS AGREEMENT.",

Stallman)\r\n\r\nEveryone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license, but changing it is not allowed. You can also use this wording to make the terms for other programs.\r\nThe license agreements of most software companies keep you at the mercy of those companies. By contrast, our general public license is intended to give everyone the right to share NetHack. To make sure that you get the rights we want you to have, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. Hence this license agreement.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, we want to make sure that you have the right to give away copies of NetHack, that you receive source code or else can get it if you want it, that you can change NetHack or use pieces of it in new free programs, and that you know you can do these things.\r\n\r\nTo make sure that everyone has such rights, we have to forbid you to deprive anyone else of these rights. For example, if you distribute copies of NetHack, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must tell them their rights.\r\n\r\nAlso, for our own protection, we must make certain that everyone finds out that there is no warranty for NetHack. If NetHack is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to know that what they have is not what we distributed.\r\n\r\nTherefore we (Mike Stephenson and other holders of NetHack copyrights) make the following terms which say what you must do to be allowed to distribute or change NetHack.\r\n\r\nCOPYING POLICIES\r\n\r\nYou may copy and distribute verbatim copies of NetHack source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you keep intact the notices on all files that refer to copyrights, to this License Agreement, and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of the NetHack program a copy of this License Agreement along with the program.\r\nYou may modify your copy or copies of NetHack or any portion of it, and copy and distribute such modifications under the terms of Paragraph 1 above (including distributing this License Agreement), provided that you also do the following:\r\na) cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any change; and\r\n\r\nb) cause the whole of any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or in part contains or is a derivative of NetHack or any part thereof, to be licensed at no charge to all third parties on terms identical to those contained in this License Agreement (except that you may choose to grant more extensive warranty protection to some or all third parties, at your option)\r\n\r\nc) You may charge a distribution fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\r\n\r\nYou may copy and distribute NetHack (or a portion or derivative of it, under Paragraph 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Paragraphs 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:\r\na) accompany it with the complete machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Paragraphs 1 and 2 above; or,\r\n\r\nb) accompany it with full information as to how to obtain the complete machine-readable source code from an appropriate archive site. (This alternative is allowed only for noncommercial distribution.)\r\n\r\nFor these purposes, complete source code means either the full source distribution as originally released over Usenet or updated copies of the files in this distribution used to create the object code or executable.\r\n\r\nYou may not copy, sublicense, distribute or transfer NetHack except as expressly provided under this License Agreement. Any attempt otherwise to copy, sublicense, distribute or transfer NetHack is void and your rights to use the program under this License agreement shall be automatically terminated. However, parties who have received computer software programs from you with this License Agreement will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.\r\nStated plainly: You are permitted to modify NetHack, or otherwise use parts of NetHack, provided that you comply with the conditions specified above; in particular, your modified NetHack or program containing parts of NetHack must remain freely available as provided in this License Agreement. In other words, go ahead and share NetHack, but don't try to stop anyone else from sharing it farther. ",

However, You\r\nmay do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial\r\nDeveloper or any Contributor.

Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.\r\n\r\nIf it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this\r\nLicense with respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to\r\nstatute or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of\r\nthis License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) Cite all of\r\nthe statutes or regulations that prohibit you from complying fully\r\nwith this license. (c) describe the limitations and the code they\r\naffect. Such description must be included in the LEGAL file\r\ndescribed in Section 3.4 and must be included with all\r\ndistributions of the Source Code. Except to the extent prohibited\r\nby statute or regulation, such description must be sufficiently\r\ndetailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand\r\nit.\r\n\r\n5. Application of this License.\r\n\r\nThis License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has\r\nattached the notice in Exhibit A, and to related Covered Code.\r\n\r\n6. Versions of the License.\r\n\r\n6.1. New Versions.\r\nLicense Author may publish revised and\/or new versions of the\r\nLicense from time to time. Each version will be given a\r\ndistinguishing version number and shall be submitted to\r\nopensource.org for certification.\r\n\r\n6.2. Effect of New Versions.\r\nOnce Covered Code has been published under a particular version of\r\nthe License, You may always continue to use it under the terms of\r\nthat version. You may also choose to use such Covered Code under\r\nthe terms of any subsequent version of the License published by\r\nInitial Developer. No one other than Initial Developer has the\r\nright to modify the terms applicable to Covered Code created under\r\nthis License.\r\n\r\n6.3. Derivative Works.\r\nIf you create or use a modified version of this License, except in\r\nassociation with the required Developer Specific License described\r\nin section 6.4, (which you may only do in order to apply it to code\r\nwhich is not already Covered Code governed by this License), you\r\nmust (a) rename Your license so that the phrases ``Open'',\r\n``OpenPL'', ``OPL'' or any confusingly similar phrase do not appear\r\nanywhere in your license and (b) otherwise make it clear that your\r\nversion of the license contains terms which differ from the Open\r\nPublic License. (Filling in the name of the Initial Developer,\r\nOriginal Code or Contributor in the notice described in Exhibit A\r\nshall not of themselves be deemed to be modifications of this\r\nLicense.)\r\n\r\n6.4. Required Additional Developer Specific License\r\n\r\nThis license is a union of the following two parts that should be\r\nfound as text files in the same place (directory), in the order of\r\npreeminence:\r\n\r\n[1] A Developer specific license.\r\n\r\n[2] The contents of this file OPL_1_0.TXT, stating the general\r\nlicensing policy of the software.\r\n\r\nIn case of conflicting dispositions in the parts of this license,\r\nthe terms of the lower-numbered part will always be superseded by\r\nthe terms of the higher numbered part.\r\n\r\n7. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.\r\n\r\nCOVERED CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN \"AS IS\" BASIS,\r\nWITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING,\r\nWITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED CODE IS FREE OF\r\nDEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR\r\nNON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF\r\nTHE COVERED CODE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED CODE PROVE\r\nDEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER\r\nCONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR\r\nCORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART\r\nOF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED CODE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER\r\nEXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.\r\n\r\n8. TERMINATION.\r\n\r\n8.1 Termination upon Breach\r\n\r\nThis License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate\r\nautomatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure\r\nsuch breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. All\r\nsublicenses to the Covered Code, which are properly granted, shall\r\nsurvive any termination of this License. Provisions that, by their\r\nnature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License\r\nshall survive.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n8.2. Termination Upon Litigation. If You initiate litigation by\r\nasserting a patent infringement claim (excluding declatory judgment\r\nactions) against Initial Developer or a Contributor (the Initial\r\nDeveloper or Contributor against whom You file such action is referred\r\nto as \"Participant\") alleging that:\r\n\r\n(a) such Participant's Contributor Version directly or\r\nindirectly infringes any patent, then any and all rights\r\ngranted by such Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and\/or\r\n2.2 of this License shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant\r\nterminate prospectively, unless if within 60 days after receipt\r\nof notice You either: (i) agree in writing to pay Participant a\r\nmutually agreeable reasonable royalty for Your past and future\r\nuse of Modifications made by such Participant, or (ii) withdraw\r\nYour litigation claim with respect to the Contributor Version\r\nagainst such Participant. If within 60 days of notice, a\r\nreasonable royalty and payment arrangement are not mutually\r\nagreed upon in writing by the parties or the litigation claim\r\nis not withdrawn, the rights granted by Participant to You\r\nunder Sections 2.1 and\/or 2.2 automatically terminate at the\r\nexpiration of the 60 day notice period specified above.\r\n\r\n(b) any software, hardware, or device, other than such\r\nParticipant's Contributor Version, directly or indirectly\r\ninfringes any patent, then any rights granted to You by such\r\nParticipant under Sections 2.1(b) and 2.2(b) are revoked\r\neffective as of the date You first made, used, sold,\r\ndistributed, or had made, Modifications made by that\r\nParticipant.\r\n\r\n8.3. If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant\r\nalleging that such Participant's Contributor Version directly or\r\nindirectly infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as\r\nby license or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent\r\ninfringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses\r\ngranted by such Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken\r\ninto account in determining the amount or value of any payment or\r\nlicense.\r\n\r\n8.4. In the event of termination under Sections 8.1 or 8.2 above, all\r\nend user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers)\r\nwhich have been validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder\r\nprior to termination shall survive termination.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.\r\n\r\nUNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT\r\n(INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL THE INITIAL\r\nDEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED CODE,\r\nOR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO YOU OR ANY OTHER\r\nPERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES\r\nOF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF\r\nGOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND\r\nALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE\r\nBEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF\r\nLIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY\r\nRESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW\r\nPROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE\r\nEXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO\r\nTHAT EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\r\n\r\n10. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.\r\n\r\nThe Covered Code is a ``commercial item,'' as that term is defined in\r\n48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of ``commercial computer\r\nsoftware'' and ``commercial computer software documentation,'' as such\r\nterms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48\r\nC.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995),\r\nall U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Code with only those\r\nrights set forth herein.\r\n\r\n11. MISCELLANEOUS.\r\n\r\nThis section was intentionally left blank. The contents of this\r\nsection are found in the corresponding addendum described above.\r\n\r\n12. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.\r\n\r\nExcept in cases where another Contributor has failed to comply with\r\nSection 3.4, You are responsible for damages arising, directly or\r\nindirectly, out of Your utilization of rights under this License,\r\nbased on the number of copies of Covered Code you made available, the\r\nrevenues you received from utilizing such rights, and other relevant\r\nfactors. You agree to work with affected parties to distribute with\r\nInitial Developer responsibility on an equitable basis.\r\n\r\nEXHIBIT A.\r\n\r\nText for this Exhibit A is found in the corresponding addendum,\r\ndescribed in section 6.4 above, text file provided by the Initial\r\nDeveloper. This license is not valid or complete with out that\r\nfile.\r\n\r\nEXHIBIT B.\r\n\r\nText for this Exhibit B is found in the corresponding addendum,\r\ndescribed in section 6.4 above, text file provided by the Initial\r\nDeveloper.

Definitions\r\n\r\n\"Adaptation\" means a work based upon the Work, or upon the Work and other pre-existing works, such as a translation, adaptation, derivative work, arrangement of music or other alterations of a literary or artistic work, or phonogram or performance and includes cinematographic adaptations or any other form in which the Work may be recast, transformed, or adapted including in any form recognizably derived from the original, except that a work that constitutes a Collection will not be considered an Adaptation for the purpose of this License. For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a musical work, performance or phonogram, the synchronization of the Work in timed-relation with a moving image (\"synching\") will be considered an Adaptation for the purpose of this License.\r\n\"Collection\" means a collection of literary or artistic works, such as encyclopedias and anthologies, or performances, phonograms or broadcasts, or other works or subject matter other than works listed in Section 1(f) below, which, by reason of the selection and arrangement of their contents, constitute intellectual creations, in which the Work is included in its entirety in unmodified form along with one or more other contributions, each constituting separate and independent works in themselves, which together are assembled into a collective whole. A work that constitutes a Collection will not be considered an Adaptation (as defined above) for the purposes of this License.\r\n\"Distribute\" means to make available to the public the original and copies of the Work or Adaptation, as appropriate, through sale or other transfer of ownership.\r\n\"Licensor\" means the individual, individuals, entity or entities that offer(s) the Work under the terms of this License.\r\n\"Original Author\" means, in the case of a literary or artistic work, the individual, individuals, entity or entities who created the Work or if no individual or entity can be identified, the publisher; and in addition (i) in the case of a performance the actors, singers, musicians, dancers, and other persons who act, sing, deliver, declaim, play in, interpret or otherwise perform literary or artistic works or expressions of folklore; (ii) in the case of a phonogram the producer being the person or legal entity who first fixes the sounds of a performance or other sounds; and, (iii) in the case of broadcasts, the organization that transmits the broadcast.\r\n\"Work\" means the literary and\/or artistic work offered under the terms of this License including without limitation any production in the literary, scientific and artistic domain, whatever may be the mode or form of its expression including digital form, such as a book, pamphlet and other writing; a lecture, address, sermon or other work of the same nature; a dramatic or dramatico-musical work; a choreographic work or entertainment in dumb show; a musical composition with or without words; a cinematographic work to which are assimilated works expressed by a process analogous to cinematography; a work of drawing, painting, architecture, sculpture, engraving or lithography; a photographic work to which are assimilated works expressed by a process analogous to photography; a work of applied art; an illustration, map, plan, sketch or three-dimensional work relative to geography, topography, architecture or science; a performance; a broadcast; a phonogram; a compilation of data to the extent it is protected as a copyrightable work; or a work performed by a variety or circus performer to the extent it is not otherwise considered a literary or artistic work.\r\n\"You\" means an individual or entity exercising rights under this License who has not previously violated the terms of this License with respect to the Work, or who has received express permission from the Licensor to exercise rights under this License despite a previous violation.\r\n\"Publicly Perform\" means to perform public recitations of the Work and to communicate to the public those public recitations, by any means or process, including by wire or wireless means or public digital performances; to make available to the public Works in such a way that members of the public may access these Works from a place and at a place individually chosen by them; to perform the Work to the public by any means or process and the communication to the public of the performances of the Work, including by public digital performance; to broadcast and rebroadcast the Work by any means including signs, sounds or images.\r\n\"Reproduce\" means to make copies of the Work by any means including without limitation by sound or visual recordings and the right of fixation and reproducing fixations of the Work, including storage of a protected performance or phonogram in digital form or other electronic medium.\r\n2. Fair Dealing Rights. Nothing in this License is intended to reduce, limit, or restrict any uses free from copyright or rights arising from limitations or exceptions that are provided for in connection with the copyright protection under copyright law or other applicable laws.\r\n\r\n3. License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright) license to exercise the rights in the Work as stated below:\r\n\r\nto Reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more Collections, and to Reproduce the Work as incorporated in the Collections;\r\nto create and Reproduce Adaptations provided that any such Adaptation, including any translation in any medium, takes reasonable steps to clearly label, demarcate or otherwise identify that changes were made to the original Work. For example, a translation could be marked \"The original work was translated from English to Spanish,\" or a modification could indicate \"The original work has been modified.\";\r\nto Distribute and Publicly Perform the Work including as incorporated in Collections; and,\r\nto Distribute and Publicly Perform Adaptations.\r\nFor the avoidance of doubt:\r\n\r\nNon-waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme cannot be waived, the Licensor reserves the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License;\r\nWaivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme can be waived, the Licensor waives the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License; and,\r\nVoluntary License Schemes. The Licensor waives the right to collect royalties, whether individually or, in the event that the Licensor is a member of a collecting society that administers voluntary licensing schemes, via that society, from any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License.\r\nThe above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now known or hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make such modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights in other media and formats. Subject to Section 8(f), all rights not expressly granted by Licensor are hereby reserved.\r\n\r\n4. Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made subject to and limited by the following restrictions:\r\n\r\nYou may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work only under the terms of this License. You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) for, this License with every copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on the Work that restrict the terms of this License or the ability of the recipient of the Work to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the License. You may not sublicense the Work. You must keep intact all notices that refer to this License and to the disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. When You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work, You may not impose any effective technological measures on the Work that restrict the ability of a recipient of the Work from You to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the License. This Section 4(a) applies to the Work as incorporated in a Collection, but this does not require the Collection apart from the Work itself to be made subject to the terms of this License. If You create a Collection, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Collection any credit as required by Section 4(b), as requested. If You create an Adaptation, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Adaptation any credit as required by Section 4(b), as requested.\r\nIf You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or any Adaptations or Collections, You must, unless a request has been made pursuant to Section 4(a), keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and provide, reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing: (i) the name of the Original Author (or pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied, and\/or if the Original Author and\/or Licensor designate another party or parties (e.g., a sponsor institute, publishing entity, journal) for attribution (\"Attribution Parties\") in Licensor's copyright notice, terms of service or by other reasonable means, the name of such party or parties; (ii) the title of the Work if supplied; (iii) to the extent reasonably practicable, the URI, if any, that Licensor specifies to be associated with the Work, unless such URI does not refer to the copyright notice or licensing information for the Work; and (iv) , consistent with Section 3(b), in the case of an Adaptation, a credit identifying the use of the Work in the Adaptation (e.g., \"French translation of the Work by Original Author,\" or \"Screenplay based on original Work by Original Author\"). The credit required by this Section 4 (b) may be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however, that in the case of a Adaptation or Collection, at a minimum such credit will appear, if a credit for all contributing authors of the Adaptation or Collection appears, then as part of these credits and in a manner at least as prominent as the credits for the other contributing authors. For the avoidance of doubt, You may only use the credit required by this Section for the purpose of attribution in the manner set out above and, by exercising Your rights under this License, You may not implicitly or explicitly assert or imply any connection with, sponsorship or endorsement by the Original Author, Licensor and\/or Attribution Parties, as appropriate, of You or Your use of the Work, without the separate, express prior written permission of the Original Author, Licensor and\/or Attribution Parties.\r\nExcept as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor or as may be otherwise permitted by applicable law, if You Reproduce, Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work either by itself or as part of any Adaptations or Collections, You must not distort, mutilate, modify or take other derogatory action in relation to the Work which would be prejudicial to the Original Author's honor or reputation. Licensor agrees that in those jurisdictions (e.g. Japan), in which any exercise of the right granted in Section 3(b) of this License (the right to make Adaptations) would be deemed to be a distortion, mutilation, modification or other derogatory action prejudicial to the Original Author's honor and reputation, the Licensor will waive or not assert, as appropriate, this Section, to the fullest extent permitted by the applicable national law, to enable You to reasonably exercise Your right under Section 3(b) of this License (right to make Adaptations) but not otherwise.\r\n5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer\r\n\r\nUNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\r\n\r\n6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\r\n\r\n7. Termination\r\n\r\nThis License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this License. Individuals or entities who have received Adaptations or Collections from You under this License, however, will not have their licenses terminated provided such individuals or entities remain in full compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any termination of this License.\r\nSubject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work). Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the Work under different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time; provided, however that any such election will not serve to withdraw this License (or any other license that has been, or is required to be, granted under the terms of this License), and this License will continue in full force and effect unless terminated as stated above.\r\n8. Miscellaneous\r\n\r\nEach time You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work or a Collection, the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.\r\nEach time You Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation, Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the original Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.\r\nIf any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this License, and without further action by the parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.\r\nNo term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or consent.\r\nThis License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings, agreements or representations with respect to the Work not specified here. Licensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions that may appear in any communication from You. This License may not be modified without the mutual written agreement of the Licensor and You.\r\nThe rights granted under, and the subject matter referenced, in this License were drafted utilizing the terminology of the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (as amended on September 28, 1979), the Rome Convention of 1961, the WIPO Copyright Treaty of 1996, the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty of 1996 and the Universal Copyright Convention (as revised on July 24, 1971). These rights and subject matter take effect in the relevant jurisdiction in which the License terms are sought to be enforced according to the corresponding provisions of the implementation of those treaty provisions in the applicable national law. If the standard suite of rights granted under applicable copyright law includes additional rights not granted under this License, such additional rights are deemed to be included in the License; this License is not intended to restrict the license of any rights under applicable law.\r\nCreative Commons Notice\r\n\r\nCreative Commons is not a party to this License, and makes no warranty whatsoever in connection with the Work.

This Agreement may be freely reproduced and published,\r\nprovided it is not altered, and that no provisions are either added or\r\nremoved herefrom.\r\n\r\nThis Agreement may apply to any or all software for which the holder of\r\nthe economic rights decides to submit the use thereof to its provisions.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Article 1 - DEFINITIONS\r\n\r\nFor the purpose of this Agreement, when the following expressions\r\ncommence with a capital letter, they shall have the following meaning:\r\n\r\nAgreement: means this license agreement, and its possible subsequent\r\nversions and annexes.\r\n\r\nSoftware: means the software in its Object Code and\/or Source Code form\r\nand, where applicable, its documentation, \"as is\" when the Licensee\r\naccepts the Agreement.\r\n\r\nInitial Software: means the Software in its Source Code and possibly its\r\nObject Code form and, where applicable, its documentation, \"as is\" when\r\nit is first distributed under the terms and conditions of the Agreement.\r\n\r\nModified Software: means the Software modified by at least one\r\nContribution.\r\n\r\nSource Code: means all the Software's instructions and program lines to\r\nwhich access is required so as to modify the Software.\r\n\r\nObject Code: means the binary files originating from the compilation of\r\nthe Source Code.\r\n\r\nHolder: means the holder(s) of the economic rights over the Initial\r\nSoftware.\r\n\r\nLicensee: means the Software user(s) having accepted the Agreement.\r\n\r\nContributor: means a Licensee having made at least one Contribution.\r\n\r\nLicensor: means the Holder, or any other individual or legal entity, who\r\ndistributes the Software under the Agreement.\r\n\r\nContribution: means any or all modifications, corrections, translations,\r\nadaptations and\/or new functions integrated into the Software by any or\r\nall Contributors, as well as any or all Internal Modules.\r\n\r\nModule: means a set of sources files including their documentation that\r\nenables supplementary functions or services in addition to those offered\r\nby the Software.\r\n\r\nExternal Module: means any or all Modules, not derived from the\r\nSoftware, so that this Module and the Software run in separate address\r\nspaces, with one calling the other when they are run.\r\n\r\nInternal Module: means any or all Module, connected to the Software so\r\nthat they both execute in the same address space.\r\n\r\nParties: mean both the Licensee and the Licensor.\r\n\r\nThese expressions may be used both in singular and plural form.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Article 2 - PURPOSE\r\n\r\nThe purpose of the Agreement is the grant by the Licensor to the\r\nLicensee of a non-exclusive, transferable and worldwide license for the\r\nSoftware as set forth in Article 5 hereinafter for the whole term of the\r\nprotection granted by the rights over said Software.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Article 3 - ACCEPTANCE\r\n\r\n3.1 The Licensee shall be deemed as having accepted the terms and\r\nconditions of this Agreement upon the occurrence of the first of the\r\nfollowing events:\r\n\r\n    * (i) loading the Software by any or all means, notably, by\r\n      downloading from a remote server, or by loading from a physical\r\n      medium;\r\n    * (ii) the first time the Licensee exercises any of the rights\r\n      granted hereunder.\r\n\r\n3.2 One copy of the Agreement, containing a notice relating to the\r\ncharacteristics of the Software, to the limited warranty, and to the\r\nfact that its use is restricted to experienced users has been provided\r\nto the Licensee prior to its acceptance as set forth in Article 3.1\r\nhereinabove, and the Licensee hereby acknowledges that it has read and\r\nunderstood it.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Article 4 - EFFECTIVE DATE AND TERM\r\n\r\n\r\n      4.1 EFFECTIVE DATE\r\n\r\nThe Agreement shall become effective on the date when it is accepted by\r\nthe Licensee as set forth in Article 3.1.\r\n\r\n\r\n      4.2 TERM\r\n\r\nThe Agreement shall remain in force for the entire legal term of\r\nprotection of the economic rights over the Software.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Article 5 - SCOPE OF RIGHTS GRANTED\r\n\r\nThe Licensor hereby grants to the Licensee, who accepts, the following\r\nrights over the Software for any or all use, and for the term of the\r\nAgreement, on the basis of the terms and conditions set forth hereinafter.\r\n\r\nBesides, if the Licensor owns or comes to own one or more patents\r\nprotecting all or part of the functions of the Software or of its\r\ncomponents, the Licensor undertakes not to enforce the rights granted by\r\nthese patents against successive Licensees using, exploiting or\r\nmodifying the Software.

In particular the Parties expressly\r\nagree that any or all pecuniary or business loss (i.e. loss of data,\r\nloss of profits, operating loss, loss of customers or orders,\r\nopportunity cost, any disturbance to business activities) or any or all\r\nlegal proceedings instituted against the Licensee by a third party,\r\nshall constitute consequential loss and shall not provide entitlement to\r\nany or all compensation from the Licensor.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Article 9 - WARRANTY\r\n\r\n9.1 The Licensee acknowledges that the scientific and technical\r\nstate-of-the-art when the Software was distributed did not enable all\r\npossible uses to be tested and verified, nor for the presence of\r\npossible defects to be detected. In this respect, the Licensee's\r\nattention has been drawn to the risks associated with loading, using,\r\nmodifying and\/or developing and reproducing the Software which are\r\nreserved for experienced users.\r\n\r\nThe Licensee shall be responsible for verifying, by any or all means,\r\nthe suitability of the product for its requirements, its good working\r\norder, and for ensuring that it shall not cause damage to either persons\r\nor properties.\r\n\r\n9.2 The Licensor hereby represents, in good faith, that it is entitled\r\nto grant all the rights over the Software (including in particular the\r\nrights set forth in Article 5).\r\n\r\n9.3 The Licensee acknowledges that the Software is supplied \"as is\" by\r\nthe Licensor without any other express or tacit warranty, other than\r\nthat provided for in Article 9.2 and, in particular, without any warranty \r\nas to its commercial value, its secured, safe, innovative or relevant \r\nnature.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, the Licensor does not warrant that the Software is free\r\nfrom any error, that it will operate without interruption, that it will\r\nbe compatible with the Licensee's own equipment and software\r\nconfiguration, nor that it will meet the Licensee's requirements.\r\n\r\n9.4 The Licensor does not either expressly or tacitly warrant that the\r\nSoftware does not infringe any third party intellectual property right\r\nrelating to a patent, software or any other property right. Therefore,\r\nthe Licensor disclaims any and all liability towards the Licensee\r\narising out of any or all proceedings for infringement that may be\r\ninstituted in respect of the use, modification and redistribution of the\r\nSoftware. Nevertheless, should such proceedings be instituted against\r\nthe Licensee, the Licensor shall provide it with technical and legal\r\nassistance for its defense. Such technical and legal assistance shall be\r\ndecided on a case-by-case basis between the relevant Licensor and the\r\nLicensee pursuant to a memorandum of understanding. The Licensor\r\ndisclaims any and all liability as regards the Licensee's use of the\r\nname of the Software. No warranty is given as regards the existence of\r\nprior rights over the name of the Software or as regards the existence\r\nof a trademark.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Article 10 - TERMINATION\r\n\r\n10.1 In the event of a breach by the Licensee of its obligations\r\nhereunder, the Licensor may automatically terminate this Agreement\r\nthirty (30) days after notice has been sent to the Licensee and has\r\nremained ineffective.\r\n\r\n10.2 A Licensee whose Agreement is terminated shall no longer be\r\nauthorized to use, modify or distribute the Software. However, any\r\nlicenses that it may have granted prior to termination of the Agreement\r\nshall remain valid subject to their having been granted in compliance\r\nwith the terms and conditions hereof.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Article 11 - MISCELLANEOUS\r\n\r\n\r\n      11.1 EXCUSABLE EVENTS\r\n\r\nNeither Party shall be liable for any or all delay, or failure to\r\nperform the Agreement, that may be attributable to an event of force\r\nmajeure, an act of God or an outside cause, such as defective\r\nfunctioning or interruptions of the electricity or telecommunications\r\nnetworks, network paralysis following a virus attack, intervention by\r\ngovernment authorities, natural disasters, water damage, earthquakes,\r\nfire, explosions, strikes and labor unrest, war, etc.\r\n\r\n11.2 Any failure by either Party, on one or more occasions, to invoke\r\none or more of the provisions hereof, shall under no circumstances be\r\ninterpreted as being a waiver by the interested Party of its right to\r\ninvoke said provision(s) subsequently.\r\n\r\n11.3 The Agreement cancels and replaces any or all previous agreements,\r\nwhether written or oral, between the Parties and having the same\r\npurpose, and constitutes the entirety of the agreement between said\r\nParties concerning said purpose.

Distribution Obligations.\r\n\r\n3.1 Application of License.\r\nThe Modifications which You create or to which You contribute are governed by the terms of this License, including without limitation Section 2.2. The Source Code version of Covered Code may be distributed only under the terms of this License or a future version of this License released under Section 6.1, and You must include a copy of this License with every copy of the Source Code You distribute. You may not offer or impose any terms on any Source Code version that alters or restricts the applicable version of this License or the recipients\u2019 rights hereunder. However, You may include an additional document offering the additional rights described in Section 3.5.\r\n\r\n3.2 Availability of Source Code.\r\nAny Modification which You create or to which You contribute must be made available in Source Code form under the terms of this License either on the same media as an Executable version or via an accepted Electronic Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom you made an Executable version available; and if made available via Electronic Distribution Mechanism, must remain available for at least twelve (12) months after the date it initially became available, or at least six (6) months after a subsequent version of that particular Modification has been made available to such recipients. You are responsible for ensuring that the Source Code version remains available even if the Electronic Distribution Mechanism is maintained by a third party.\r\n\r\n3.3 Description of Modifications.\r\nYou must cause all Covered Code to which You contribute to contain a file documenting the changes You made to create that Covered Code and the date of any change. You must include a prominent statement that the Modification is derived, directly or indirectly, from Original Code provided by the Initial Developer and including the name of the Initial Developer in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in any notice in an Executable version or related documentation in which You describe the origin or ownership of the Covered Code.\r\n\r\n3.4 Intellectual Property Matters\r\n\r\n(a) Third Party Claims. If Contributor has knowledge that a license under a third party\u2019s intellectual property rights is required to exercise the rights granted by such Contributor under Sections 2.1 or 2.2, Contributor must include a text file with the Source Code distribution titled \u201cLEGAL\u201d which describes the claim and the party making the claim in sufficient detail that a recipient will know whom to contact. If Contributor obtains such knowledge after the Modification is made available as described in Section 3.2, Contributor shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies Contributor makes available thereafter and shall take other steps (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably calculated to inform those who received the Covered Code that new knowledge has been obtained.\r\n\r\n(b) Contributor APIs. If Contributor\u2019s Modifications include an application programming interface and Contributor has knowledge of patent licenses which are reasonably necessary to implement that API, Contributor must also include this information in the LEGAL file.\r\n\r\n(c) Representations. Contributor represents that, except as disclosed pursuant to Section 3.4(a) above, Contributor believes that Contributor\u2019s Modifications are Contributor\u2019s original creation(s) and\/or Contributor has sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by this License.\r\n\r\n3.5 Required Notices.\r\nYou must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source Code. If it is not possible to put such notice in a particular Source Code file due to its structure, then You must include such notice in a location (such as a relevant directory) where a user would be likely to look for such a notice. If You created one or more Modification(s) You may add your name as a Contributor to the notice described in Exhibit A. You must also duplicate this License in any documentation for the Source Code where You describe recipients\u2019 rights or ownership rights relating to Covered Code. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Code. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear than any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.\r\n\r\n3.6 Distribution of Executable Versions.\r\nYou may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the requirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered Code, and if You include a notice stating that the Source Code version of the Covered Code is available under the terms of this License, including a description of how and where You have fulfilled the obligations of Section 3.2. The notice must be conspicuously included in any notice in an Executable version, related documentation or collateral in which You describe recipients\u2019 rights relating to the Covered Code. You may distribute the Executable version of Covered Code or ownership rights under a license of Your choice, which may contain terms different from this License, provided that You are in compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the Executable version does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient\u2019s rights in the Source Code version from the rights set forth in this License. If You distribute the Executable version under a different license You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ from this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer, Original Developer or any Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer, Original Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer, Original Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such terms You offer.\r\n\r\n3.7 Larger Works.\r\nYou may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other code not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code.\r\n\r\n4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.\r\nIf it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License with respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must be included in the LEGAL file described in Section 3.4 and must be included with all distributions of the Source Code. Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.\r\n\r\n5. Application of this License.\r\nThis License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has attached the notice in Exhibit A and to related Covered Code.\r\n\r\n6. Versions of the License.\r\n\r\n6.1 New Versions.\r\nSocialtext, Inc. (\u201cSocialtext\u201d) may publish revised and\/or new versions of the License from time to time. Each version will be given a distinguishing version number.\r\n\r\n6.2 Effect of New Versions.\r\nOnce Covered Code has been published under a particular version of the License, You may always continue to use it under the terms of that version. You may also choose to use such Covered Code under the terms of any subsequent version of the License published by Socialtext. No one other than Socialtext has the right to modify the terms applicable to Covered Code created under this License.\r\n\r\n6.3 Derivative Works.\r\nIf You create or use a modified version of this License (which you may only do in order to apply it to code which is not already Covered Code governed by this License), You must (a) rename Your license so that the phrases \u201cSocialtext\u201d, \u201cCPAL\u201d or any confusingly similar phrase do not appear in your license (except to note that your license differs from this License) and (b) otherwise make it clear that Your version of the license contains terms which differ from the CPAL. (Filling in the name of the Initial Developer, Original Developer, Original Code or Contributor in the notice described in Exhibit A shall not of themselves be deemed to be modifications of this License.)\r\n\r\n7. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.\r\nCOVERED CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN \u201cAS IS\u201d BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED CODE IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED CODE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED CODE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, ORIGINAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED CODE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.\r\n\r\n8. TERMINATION.\r\n\r\n8.1 This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. All sublicenses to the Covered Code which are properly granted shall survive any termination of this License. Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License shall survive.\r\n\r\n8.2 If You initiate litigation by asserting a patent infringement claim (excluding declatory judgment actions) against Initial Developer, Original Developer or a Contributor (the Initial Developer, Original Developer or Contributor against whom You file such action is referred to as \u201cParticipant\u201d) alleging that:\r\n\r\n(a) such Participant\u2019s Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted by such Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and\/or 2.2 of this License shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate prospectively, unless if within 60 days after receipt of notice You either: (i) agree in writing to pay Participant a mutually agreeable reasonable royalty for Your past and future use of Modifications made by such Participant, or (ii) withdraw Your litigation claim with respect to the Contributor Version against such Participant. If within 60 days of notice, a reasonable royalty and payment arrangement are not mutually agreed upon in writing by the parties or the litigation claim is not withdrawn, the rights granted by Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and\/or 2.2 automatically terminate at the expiration of the 60 day notice period specified above.\r\n\r\n(b) any software, hardware, or device, other than such Participant\u2019s Contributor Version, directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any rights granted to You by such Participant under Sections 2.1(b) and 2.2(b) are revoked effective as of the date You first made, used, sold, distributed, or had made, Modifications made by that Participant.\r\n\r\n8.3 If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant alleging that such Participant\u2019s Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as by license or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses granted by such Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken into account in determining the amount or value of any payment or license.\r\n\r\n8.4 In the event of termination under Sections 8.1 or 8.2 above, all end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder prior to termination shall survive termination.\r\n\r\n9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.\r\nUNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, ORIGINAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED CODE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY\u2019S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\r\n\r\n10. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.\r\nThe Covered Code is a \u201ccommercial item,\u201d as that term is defined in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of \u201ccommercial computer software\u201d and \u201ccommercial computer software documentation,\u201d as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Code with only those rights set forth herein.\r\n\r\n11. MISCELLANEOUS.\r\nThis License represents the complete agreement concerning subject matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be governed by California law provisions (except to the extent applicable law, if any, provides otherwise), excluding its conflict-of-law provisions. With respect to disputes in which at least one party is a citizen of, or an entity chartered or registered to do business in the United States of America, any litigation relating to this License shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Courts of the Northern District of California, with venue lying in Santa Clara County, California, with the losing party responsible for costs, including without limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees and expenses. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not apply to this License.\r\n\r\n12. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.\r\nAs between Initial Developer, Original Developer and the Contributors, each party is responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly, out of its utilization of rights under this License and You agree to work with Initial Developer, Original Developer and Contributors to distribute such responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing herein is intended or shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability.\r\n\r\n13. MULTIPLE-LICENSED CODE.\r\nInitial Developer may designate portions of the Covered Code as Multiple-Licensed. Multiple-Licensed means that the Initial Developer permits you to utilize portions of the Covered Code under Your choice of the CPAL or the alternative licenses, if any, specified by the Initial Developer in the file described in Exhibit A.\r\n\r\n14. ADDITIONAL TERM: ATTRIBUTION\r\n\r\n(a) As a modest attribution to the organizer of the development of the Original Code (\u201cOriginal Developer\u201d), in the hope that its promotional value may help justify the time, money and effort invested in writing the Original Code, the Original Developer may include in Exhibit B (\u201cAttribution Information\u201d) a requirement that each time an Executable and Source Code or a Larger Work is launched or initially run (which includes initiating a session), a prominent display of the Original Developer\u2019s Attribution Information (as defined below) must occur on the graphic user interface employed by the end user to access such Covered Code (which may include display on a splash screen), if any. The size of the graphic image should be consistent with the size of the other elements of the Attribution Information. If the access by the end user to the Executable and Source Code does not create a graphic user interface for access to the Covered Code, this obligation shall not apply. If the Original Code displays such Attribution Information in a particular form (such as in the form of a splash screen, notice at login, an \u201cabout\u201d display, or dedicated attribution area on user interface screens), continued use of such form for that Attribution Information is one way of meeting this requirement for notice.\r\n\r\n(b) Attribution information may only include a copyright notice, a brief phrase, graphic image and a URL (\u201cAttribution Information\u201d) and is subject to the Attribution Limits as defined below. For these purposes, prominent shall mean display for sufficient duration to give reasonable notice to the user of the identity of the Original Developer and that if You include Attribution Information or similar information for other parties, You must ensure that the Attribution Information for the Original Developer shall be no less prominent than such Attribution Information or similar information for the other party. For greater certainty, the Original Developer may choose to specify in Exhibit B below that the above attribution requirement only applies to an Executable and Source Code resulting from the Original Code or any Modification, but not a Larger Work. The intent is to provide for reasonably modest attribution, therefore the Original Developer cannot require that You display, at any time, more than the following information as Attribution Information: (a) a copyright notice including the name of the Original Developer; (b) a word or one phrase (not exceeding 10 words); (c) one graphic image provided by the Original Developer; and (d) a URL (collectively, the \u201cAttribution Limits\u201d).\r\n\r\n(c) If Exhibit B does not include any Attribution Information, then there are no requirements for You to display any Attribution Information of the Original Developer.\r\n\r\n(d) You acknowledge that all trademarks, service marks and\/or trade names contained within the Attribution Information distributed with the Covered Code are the exclusive property of their owners and may only be used with the permission of their owners, or under circumstances otherwise permitted by law or as expressly set out in this License.\r\n\r\n15. ADDITIONAL TERM: NETWORK USE.\r\nThe term \u201cExternal Deployment\u201d means the use, distribution, or communication of the Original Code or Modifications in any way such that the Original Code or Modifications may be used by anyone other than You, whether those works are distributed or communicated to those persons or made available as an application intended for use over a network. As an express condition for the grants of license hereunder, You must treat any External Deployment by You of the Original Code or Modifications as a distribution under section 3.1 and make Source Code available under Section 3.2.\r\n\r\nEXHIBIT A. Common Public Attribution License Version 1.0.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe contents of this file are subject to the Common Public Attribution License Version 1.0 (the \u201cLicense\u201d); you may not use this file except in compliance with the License. You may obtain a copy of the License at _____________. The License is based on the Mozilla Public License Version 1.1 but Sections 14 and 15 have been added to cover use of software over a computer network and provide for limited attribution for the Original Developer. In addition, Exhibit A has been modified to be consistent with Exhibit B.\r\nSoftware distributed under the License is distributed on an \u201cAS IS\u201d basis, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, either express or implied. See the License for the specific language governing rights and limitations under the License.\r\nThe Original Code is______________________.\r\nThe Original Developer is not the Initial Developer and is __________. If left blank, the Original Developer is the Initial Developer.\r\nThe Initial Developer of the Original Code is ____________. All portions of the code written by ___________ are Copyright (c) _____. All Rights Reserved.\r\nContributor ______________________.\r\nAlternatively, the contents of this file may be used under the terms of the _____ license (the [___] License), in which case the provisions of [______] License are applicable instead of those above.\r\nIf you wish to allow use of your version of this file only under the terms of the [____] License and not to allow others to use your version of this file under the CPAL, indicate your decision by deleting the provisions above and replace them with the notice and other provisions required by the [___] License. If you do not delete the provisions above, a recipient may use your version of this file under either the CPAL or the [___] License.\u201d\r\n\r\n[NOTE: The text of this Exhibit A may differ slightly from the text of the notices in the Source Code files of the Original Code. You should use the text of this Exhibit A rather than the text found in the Original Code Source Code for Your Modifications.]\r\n\r\nEXHIBIT B.

PREAMBLE.\r\n\r\nCopyright law gives certain exclusive rights to the author of a work, including the rights to copy, modify and distribute the work (the \"reproductive,\" \"adaptative,\" and \"distribution\" rights).\r\n\r\nThe idea of \"copyleft\" is to willfully revoke the exclusivity of those rights under certain terms and conditions, so that anyone can copy and distribute the work or properly attributed derivative works, while all copies remain under the same terms and conditions as the original.\r\n\r\nThe intent of this license is to be a general \"copyleft\" that can be applied to any kind of work that has protection under copyright. This license states those certain conditions under which a work published under its terms may be copied, distributed, and modified.\r\n\r\nWhereas \"design science\" is a strategy for the development of artifacts as a way to reform the environment (not people) and subsequently improve the universal standard of living, this Design Science License was written and deployed as a strategy for promoting the progress of science and art through reform of the environment.\r\n\r\n1. DEFINITIONS.\r\n\r\n\"License\" shall mean this Design Science License. The License applies to any work which contains a notice placed by the work's copyright holder stating that it is published under the terms of this Design Science License.\r\n\r\n\"Work\" shall mean such an aforementioned work. The License also applies to the output of the Work, only if said output constitutes a \"derivative work\" of the licensed Work as defined by copyright law.\r\n\r\n\"Object Form\" shall mean an executable or performable form of the Work, being an embodiment of the Work in some tangible medium.\r\n\r\n\"Source Data\" shall mean the origin of the Object Form, being the entire, machine-readable, preferred form of the Work for copying and for human modification (usually the language, encoding or format in which composed or recorded by the Author); plus any accompanying files, scripts or other data necessary for installation, configuration or compilation of the Work.\r\n\r\n(Examples of \"Source Data\" include, but are not limited to, the following: if the Work is an image file composed and edited in PNG format, then the original PNG source file is the Source Data; if the Work is an MPEG 1.0 layer 3 digital audio recording made from a WAV format audio file recording of an analog source, then the original WAV file is the Source Data; if the Work was composed as an unformatted plaintext file, then that file is the Source Data; if the Work was composed in LaTeX, the LaTeX file(s) and any image files and\/or custom macros necessary for compilation constitute the Source Data.)\r\n\r\n\"Author\" shall mean the copyright holder(s) of the Work. The individual licensees are referred to as \"you.\"\r\n\r\n2. RIGHTS AND COPYRIGHT.\r\n\r\nThe Work is copyrighted by the Author. All rights to the Work are reserved by the Author, except as specifically described below. This License describes the terms and conditions under which the Author permits you to copy, distribute and modify copies of the Work.\r\n\r\nIn addition, you may refer to the Work, talk about it, and (as dictated by \"fair use\") quote from it, just as you would any copyrighted material under copyright law.\r\n\r\nYour right to operate, perform, read or otherwise interpret and\/or execute the Work is unrestricted; however, you do so at your own risk, because the Work comes WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY -- see Section 7 (\"NO WARRANTY\") below.\r\n\r\n3. COPYING AND DISTRIBUTION.\r\n\r\nPermission is granted to distribute, publish or otherwise present verbatim copies of the entire Source Data of the Work, in any medium, provided that full copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty, where applicable, is conspicuously published on all copies, and a copy of this License is distributed along with the Work.\r\n\r\nPermission is granted to distribute, publish or otherwise present copies of the Object Form of the Work, in any medium, under the terms for distribution of Source Data above and also provided that one of the following additional conditions are met:\r\n\r\n(a) The Source Data is included in the same distribution, distributed under the terms of this License; or\r\n\r\n(b) A written offer is included with the distribution, valid for at least three years or for as long as the distribution is in print (whichever is longer), with a publicly-accessible address (such as a URL on the Internet) where, for a charge not greater than transportation and media costs, anyone may receive a copy of the Source Data of the Work distributed according to the section above; or\r\n\r\n(c) A third party's written offer for obtaining the Source Data at no cost, as described in paragraph (b) above, is included with the distribution. This option is valid only if you are a non-commercial party, and only if you received the Object Form of the Work along with such an offer.\r\n\r\nYou may copy and distribute the Work either gratis or for a fee, and if desired, you may offer warranty protection for the Work.\r\n\r\nThe aggregation of the Work with other works that are not based on the Work -- such as but not limited to inclusion in a publication, broadcast, compilation, or other media -- does not bring the other works in the scope of the License; nor does such aggregation void the terms of the License for the Work.\r\n\r\n4. MODIFICATION.\r\n\r\nPermission is granted to modify or sample from a copy of the Work, producing a derivative work, and to distribute the derivative work under the terms described in the section for distribution above, provided that the following terms are met:\r\n\r\n(a) The new, derivative work is published under the terms of this License.\r\n\r\n(b) The derivative work is given a new name, so that its name or title cannot be confused with the Work, or with a version of the Work, in any way.\r\n\r\n(c) Appropriate authorship credit is given: for the differences between the Work and the new derivative work, authorship is attributed to you, while the material sampled or used from the Work remains attributed to the original Author; appropriate notice must be included with the new work indicating the nature and the dates of any modifications of the Work made by you.\r\n\r\n5. NO RESTRICTIONS.\r\n\r\nYou may not impose any further restrictions on the Work or any of its derivative works beyond those restrictions described in this License.\r\n\r\n6. ACCEPTANCE.\r\n\r\nCopying, distributing or modifying the Work (including but not limited to sampling from the Work in a new work) indicates acceptance of these terms. If you do not follow the terms of this License, any rights granted to you by the License are null and void. The copying, distribution or modification of the Work outside of the terms described in this License is expressly prohibited by law.\r\n\r\nIf for any reason, conditions are imposed on you that forbid you to fulfill the conditions of this License, you may not copy, distribute or modify the Work at all.\r\n\r\nIf any part of this License is found to be in conflict with the law, that part shall be interpreted in its broadest meaning consistent with the law, and no other parts of the License shall be affected.\r\n\r\n7. NO WARRANTY.\r\n\r\nTHE WORK IS PROVIDED \"AS IS,\" AND COMES WITH ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.\r\n\r\n8. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY.\r\n\r\nIN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHOR OR CONTRIBUTORS BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, PROCUREMENT OF SUBSTITUTE GOODS OR SERVICES; LOSS OF USE, DATA, OR PROFITS; OR BUSINESS INTERRUPTION) HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OF THIS WORK, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE.\r\n\r\nEND OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS",

This license may be particularly\r\nsuitable if your work is TeX-related (such as a LaTeX package), but \r\nit is written in such a way that you can use it even if your work is \r\nunrelated to TeX.\r\n\r\nThe section `WHETHER AND HOW TO DISTRIBUTE WORKS UNDER THIS LICENSE',\r\nbelow, gives instructions, examples, and recommendations for authors\r\nwho are considering distributing their works under this license.\r\n\r\nThis license gives conditions under which a work may be distributed\r\nand modified, as well as conditions under which modified versions of\r\nthat work may be distributed.\r\n\r\nWe, the LaTeX3 Project, believe that the conditions below give you\r\nthe freedom to make and distribute modified versions of your work\r\nthat conform with whatever technical specifications you wish while\r\nmaintaining the availability, integrity, and reliability of\r\nthat work.  If you do not see how to achieve your goal while\r\nmeeting these conditions, then read the document `cfgguide.tex'\r\nand `modguide.tex' in the base LaTeX distribution for suggestions.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEFINITIONS\r\n===========\r\n\r\nIn this license document the following terms are used:\r\n\r\n   `Work'\r\n    Any work being distributed under this License.\r\n    \r\n   `Derived Work'\r\n    Any work that under any applicable law is derived from the Work.\r\n\r\n   `Modification' \r\n    Any procedure that produces a Derived Work under any applicable\r\n    law -- for example, the production of a file containing an\r\n    original file associated with the Work or a significant portion of\r\n    such a file, either verbatim or with modifications and\/or\r\n    translated into another language.\r\n\r\n   `Modify'\r\n    To apply any procedure that produces a Derived Work under any\r\n    applicable law.\r\n    \r\n   `Distribution'\r\n    Making copies of the Work available from one person to another, in\r\n    whole or in part.  Distribution includes (but is not limited to)\r\n    making any electronic components of the Work accessible by\r\n    file transfer protocols such as FTP or HTTP or by shared file\r\n    systems such as Sun's Network File System (NFS).\r\n\r\n   `Compiled Work'\r\n    A version of the Work that has been processed into a form where it\r\n    is directly usable on a computer system.  This processing may\r\n    include using installation facilities provided by the Work,\r\n    transformations of the Work, copying of components of the Work, or\r\n    other activities.  Note that modification of any installation\r\n    facilities provided by the Work constitutes modification of the Work.\r\n\r\n   `Current Maintainer'\r\n    A person or persons nominated as such within the Work.  If there is\r\n    no such explicit nomination then it is the `Copyright Holder' under\r\n    any applicable law.\r\n\r\n   `Base Interpreter' \r\n    A program or process that is normally needed for running or\r\n    interpreting a part or the whole of the Work.    \r\n\r\n    A Base Interpreter may depend on external components but these\r\n    are not considered part of the Base Interpreter provided that each\r\n    external component clearly identifies itself whenever it is used\r\n    interactively.  Unless explicitly specified when applying the\r\n    license to the Work, the only applicable Base Interpreter is a\r\n    `LaTeX-Format' or in the case of files belonging to the \r\n    `LaTeX-format' a program implementing the `TeX language'.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONDITIONS ON DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\r\n===========================================\r\n\r\n1.  Activities other than distribution and\/or modification of the Work\r\nare not covered by this license; they are outside its scope.  In\r\nparticular, the act of running the Work is not restricted and no\r\nrequirements are made concerning any offers of support for the Work.\r\n\r\n2.  You may distribute a complete, unmodified copy of the Work as you\r\nreceived it.  Distribution of only part of the Work is considered\r\nmodification of the Work, and no right to distribute such a Derived\r\nWork may be assumed under the terms of this clause.\r\n\r\n3.  You may distribute a Compiled Work that has been generated from a\r\ncomplete, unmodified copy of the Work as distributed under Clause 2\r\nabove, as long as that Compiled Work is distributed in such a way that\r\nthe recipients may install the Compiled Work on their system exactly\r\nas it would have been installed if they generated a Compiled Work\r\ndirectly from the Work.\r\n\r\n4.  If you are the Current Maintainer of the Work, you may, without\r\nrestriction, modify the Work, thus creating a Derived Work.  You may\r\nalso distribute the Derived Work without restriction, including\r\nCompiled Works generated from the Derived Work.  Derived Works\r\ndistributed in this manner by the Current Maintainer are considered to\r\nbe updated versions of the Work.\r\n\r\n5.  If you are not the Current Maintainer of the Work, you may modify\r\nyour copy of the Work, thus creating a Derived Work based on the Work,\r\nand compile this Derived Work, thus creating a Compiled Work based on\r\nthe Derived Work.\r\n\r\n6.  If you are not the Current Maintainer of the Work, you may\r\ndistribute a Derived Work provided the following conditions are met\r\nfor every component of the Work unless that component clearly states\r\nin the copyright notice that it is exempt from that condition.  Only\r\nthe Current Maintainer is allowed to add such statements of exemption \r\nto a component of the Work. \r\n\r\n  a. If a component of this Derived Work can be a direct replacement\r\n     for a component of the Work when that component is used with the\r\n     Base Interpreter, then, wherever this component of the Work\r\n     identifies itself to the user when used interactively with that\r\n     Base Interpreter, the replacement component of this Derived Work\r\n     clearly and unambiguously identifies itself as a modified version\r\n     of this component to the user when used interactively with that\r\n     Base Interpreter.\r\n     \r\n  b. Every component of the Derived Work contains prominent notices\r\n     detailing the nature of the changes to that component, or a\r\n     prominent reference to another file that is distributed as part\r\n     of the Derived Work and that contains a complete and accurate log\r\n     of the changes.\r\n  \r\n  c. No information in the Derived Work implies that any persons,\r\n     including (but not limited to) the authors of the original version\r\n     of the Work, provide any support, including (but not limited to)\r\n     the reporting and handling of errors, to recipients of the\r\n     Derived Work unless those persons have stated explicitly that\r\n     they do provide such support for the Derived Work.\r\n\r\n  d. You distribute at least one of the following with the Derived Work:\r\n\r\n       1. A complete, unmodified copy of the Work; \r\n          if your distribution of a modified component is made by\r\n          offering access to copy the modified component from a\r\n          designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy\r\n          the Work from the same or some similar place meets this\r\n          condition, even though third parties are not compelled to\r\n          copy the Work along with the modified component;\r\n\r\n       2. Information that is sufficient to obtain a complete,\r\n          unmodified copy of the Work.\r\n\r\n7.  If you are not the Current Maintainer of the Work, you may\r\ndistribute a Compiled Work generated from a Derived Work, as long as\r\nthe Derived Work is distributed to all recipients of the Compiled\r\nWork, and as long as the conditions of Clause 6, above, are met with\r\nregard to the Derived Work.\r\n\r\n8.  The conditions above are not intended to prohibit, and hence do not\r\napply to, the modification, by any method, of any component so that it\r\nbecomes identical to an updated version of that component of the Work as\r\nit is distributed by the Current Maintainer under Clause 4, above.\r\n\r\n9.  Distribution of the Work or any Derived Work in an alternative\r\nformat, where the Work or that Derived Work (in whole or in part) is\r\nthen produced by applying some process to that format, does not relax or\r\nnullify any sections of this license as they pertain to the results of\r\napplying that process.\r\n     \r\n10. a. A Derived Work may be distributed under a different license\r\n       provided that license itself honors the conditions listed in\r\n       Clause 6 above, in regard to the Work, though it does not have\r\n       to honor the rest of the conditions in this license.\r\n      \r\n    b. If a Derived Work is distributed under a different license, that\r\n       Derived Work must provide sufficient documentation as part of\r\n       itself to allow each recipient of that Derived Work to honor the \r\n       restrictions in Clause 6 above, concerning changes from the Work.\r\n\r\n11. This license places no restrictions on works that are unrelated to\r\nthe Work, nor does this license place any restrictions on aggregating\r\nsuch works with the Work by any means.\r\n\r\n12.  Nothing in this license is intended to, or may be used to, prevent\r\ncomplete compliance by all parties with all applicable laws.\r\n\r\n\r\nNO WARRANTY\r\n===========\r\n\r\nThere is no warranty for the Work.  Except when otherwise stated in\r\nwriting, the Copyright Holder provides the Work `as is', without\r\nwarranty of any kind, either expressed or implied, including, but not\r\nlimited to, the implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a\r\nparticular purpose.  The entire risk as to the quality and performance\r\nof the Work is with you.  Should the Work prove defective, you assume\r\nthe cost of all necessary servicing, repair, or correction.\r\n\r\nIn no event unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing\r\nwill The Copyright Holder, or any author named in the components of the\r\nWork, or any other party who may distribute and\/or modify the Work as\r\npermitted above, be liable to you for damages, including any general,\r\nspecial, incidental or consequential damages arising out of any use of\r\nthe Work or out of inability to use the Work (including, but not limited\r\nto, loss of data, data being rendered inaccurate, or losses sustained by\r\nanyone as a result of any failure of the Work to operate with any other\r\nprograms), even if the Copyright Holder or said author or said other\r\nparty has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\r\n\r\n\r\nMAINTENANCE OF THE WORK\r\n=======================\r\n\r\nThe Work has the status `author-maintained' if the Copyright Holder\r\nexplicitly and prominently states near the primary copyright notice in\r\nthe Work that the Work can only be maintained by the Copyright Holder\r\nor simply that it is `author-maintained'.\r\n\r\nThe Work has the status `maintained' if there is a Current Maintainer\r\nwho has indicated in the Work that they are willing to receive error\r\nreports for the Work (for example, by supplying a valid e-mail\r\naddress). It is not required for the Current Maintainer to acknowledge\r\nor act upon these error reports.\r\n\r\nThe Work changes from status `maintained' to `unmaintained' if there\r\nis no Current Maintainer, or the person stated to be Current\r\nMaintainer of the work cannot be reached through the indicated means\r\nof communication for a period of six months, and there are no other\r\nsignificant signs of active maintenance.\r\n\r\nYou can become the Current Maintainer of the Work by agreement with\r\nany existing Current Maintainer to take over this role.\r\n\r\nIf the Work is unmaintained, you can become the Current Maintainer of\r\nthe Work through the following steps:\r\n\r\n 1.  Make a reasonable attempt to trace the Current Maintainer (and\r\n     the Copyright Holder, if the two differ) through the means of\r\n     an Internet or similar search.\r\n\r\n 2.  If this search is successful, then enquire whether the Work\r\n     is still maintained.\r\n\r\n  a. If it is being maintained, then ask the Current Maintainer\r\n     to update their communication data within one month.\r\n     \r\n  b. If the search is unsuccessful or no action to resume active\r\n     maintenance is taken by the Current Maintainer, then announce\r\n     within the pertinent community your intention to take over\r\n     maintenance.  (If the Work is a LaTeX work, this could be\r\n     done, for example, by posting to comp.text.tex.)\r\n\r\n 3a. If the Current Maintainer is reachable and agrees to pass\r\n     maintenance of the Work to you, then this takes effect\r\n     immediately upon announcement.\r\n     \r\n  b. If the Current Maintainer is not reachable and the Copyright\r\n     Holder agrees that maintenance of the Work be passed to you,\r\n     then this takes effect immediately upon announcement.  \r\n    \r\n 4.  If you make an `intention announcement' as described in 2b. above\r\n     and after three months your intention is challenged neither by\r\n     the Current Maintainer nor by the Copyright Holder nor by other\r\n     people, then you may arrange for the Work to be changed so as\r\n     to name you as the (new) Current Maintainer.\r\n     \r\n 5.  If the previously unreachable Current Maintainer becomes\r\n     reachable once more within three months of a change completed\r\n     under the terms of 3b) or 4), then that Current Maintainer must\r\n     become or remain the Current Maintainer upon request provided\r\n     they then update their communication data within one month.\r\n\r\nA change in the Current Maintainer does not, of itself, alter the fact\r\nthat the Work is distributed under the LPPL license.\r\n\r\nIf you become the Current Maintainer of the Work, you should\r\nimmediately provide, within the Work, a prominent and unambiguous\r\nstatement of your status as Current Maintainer.  You should also\r\nannounce your new status to the same pertinent community as\r\nin 2b) above.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHETHER AND HOW TO DISTRIBUTE WORKS UNDER THIS LICENSE\r\n======================================================\r\n\r\nThis section contains important instructions, examples, and\r\nrecommendations for authors who are considering distributing their\r\nworks under this license.  These authors are addressed as `you' in\r\nthis section.\r\n\r\nChoosing This License or Another License\r\n----------------------------------------\r\n\r\nIf for any part of your work you want or need to use *distribution*\r\nconditions that differ significantly from those in this license, then\r\ndo not refer to this license anywhere in your work but, instead,\r\ndistribute your work under a different license.  You may use the text\r\nof this license as a model for your own license, but your license\r\nshould not refer to the LPPL or otherwise give the impression that\r\nyour work is distributed under the LPPL.\r\n\r\nThe document `modguide.tex' in the base LaTeX distribution explains\r\nthe motivation behind the conditions of this license.  It explains,\r\nfor example, why distributing LaTeX under the GNU General Public\r\nLicense (GPL) was considered inappropriate.  Even if your work is\r\nunrelated to LaTeX, the discussion in `modguide.tex' may still be\r\nrelevant, and authors intending to distribute their works under any\r\nlicense are encouraged to read it.\r\n\r\nA Recommendation on Modification Without Distribution\r\n-----------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nIt is wise never to modify a component of the Work, even for your own\r\npersonal use, without also meeting the above conditions for\r\ndistributing the modified component.  While you might intend that such\r\nmodifications will never be distributed, often this will happen by\r\naccident -- you may forget that you have modified that component; or\r\nit may not occur to you when allowing others to access the modified\r\nversion that you are thus distributing it and violating the conditions\r\nof this license in ways that could have legal implications and, worse,\r\ncause problems for the community.  It is therefore usually in your\r\nbest interest to keep your copy of the Work identical with the public\r\none.  Many works provide ways to control the behavior of that work\r\nwithout altering any of its licensed components.\r\n\r\nHow to Use This License\r\n-----------------------\r\n\r\nTo use this license, place in each of the components of your work both\r\nan explicit copyright notice including your name and the year the work\r\nwas authored and\/or last substantially modified.  Include also a\r\nstatement that the distribution and\/or modification of that\r\ncomponent is constrained by the conditions in this license.\r\n\r\nHere is an example of such a notice and statement:\r\n\r\n  %% pig.dtx\r\n  %% Copyright 2005 M. Y. Name\r\n  %\r\n  % This work may be distributed and\/or modified under the\r\n  % conditions of the LaTeX Project Public License, either version 1.3\r\n  % of this license or (at your option) any later version.\r\n  % The latest version of this license is in\r\n  %   http:\/\/www.latex-project.org\/lppl.txt\r\n  % and version 1.3 or later is part of all distributions of LaTeX\r\n  % version 2005\/12\/01 or later.\r\n  %\r\n  % This work has the LPPL maintenance status `maintained'.\r\n  % \r\n  % The Current Maintainer of this work is M. Y. Name.\r\n  %\r\n  % This work consists of the files pig.dtx and pig.ins\r\n  % and the derived file pig.sty.\r\n\r\nGiven such a notice and statement in a file, the conditions\r\ngiven in this license document would apply, with the `Work' referring\r\nto the three files `pig.dtx', `pig.ins', and `pig.sty' (the last being\r\ngenerated from `pig.dtx' using `pig.ins'), the `Base Interpreter'\r\nreferring to any `LaTeX-Format', and both `Copyright Holder' and\r\n`Current Maintainer' referring to the person `M. Y. Name'.\r\n\r\nIf you do not want the Maintenance section of LPPL to apply to your\r\nWork, change `maintained' above into `author-maintained'.  \r\nHowever, we recommend that you use `maintained', as the Maintenance\r\nsection was added in order to ensure that your Work remains useful to\r\nthe community even when you can no longer maintain and support it\r\nyourself.\r\n\r\nDerived Works That Are Not Replacements\r\n---------------------------------------\r\n\r\nSeveral clauses of the LPPL specify means to provide reliability and\r\nstability for the user community. They therefore concern themselves\r\nwith the case that a Derived Work is intended to be used as a\r\n(compatible or incompatible) replacement of the original Work. If\r\nthis is not the case (e.g., if a few lines of code are reused for a\r\ncompletely different task), then clauses 6b and 6d shall not apply.\r\n\r\n\r\nImportant Recommendations\r\n-------------------------\r\n\r\n Defining What Constitutes the Work\r\n\r\n   The LPPL requires that distributions of the Work contain all the\r\n   files of the Work.  It is therefore important that you provide a\r\n   way for the licensee to determine which files constitute the Work.\r\n   This could, for example, be achieved by explicitly listing all the\r\n   files of the Work near the copyright notice of each file or by\r\n   using a line such as:\r\n\r\n    % This work consists of all files listed in manifest.txt.\r\n   \r\n   in that place.  In the absence of an unequivocal list it might be\r\n   impossible for the licensee to determine what is considered by you\r\n   to comprise the Work and, in such a case, the licensee would be\r\n   entitled to make reasonable conjectures as to which files comprise\r\n   the Work.\r\n",

IDDN.FR.001.130017.00.R.P.2000.000.20900. at the program protection Agency situated in Paris (119 Rue de Flandres, 75019 PARIS - France)\r\n\r\nThe CNES grants the licensee, be it a physical person or legal entity, a free non-exclusive license.\r\n\r\nThis license is established in French and English, the French version being the sole binding version.\r\n\r\nThe license is subject to French law.\r\n\r\nIn the event of a dispute, the latter will be presented before the Paris court that has jurisdiction.\r\n\r\nTRANSFERRED RIGHTS\r\n\r\nOn this \"OASIS\" software available in source code accompanied by the instructions, the CNES grants the licensee the right to use, reproduce, translate, modify and adapt and incorporate the software into another software.\r\n\r\nFor the initial version of the \"OASIS\" software or translations thereof, new versions or versions implying incorporation of the \"OASIS\" software into another software carried out by the licensee, the latter can redistribute them free of charge accompanied by the same rights as stipulated above, to the exclusion of all other rights. However, redistribution of the \"OASIS\" software by the licensee is authorised under the express understanding that the rights in the sub-licenses, in view of what belongs to the CNES in these translations or new versions, be transferred under the same conditions as those provided for in this license. It is understood that the licensee will himself obtain from the sub-licensees for the benefit of the CNES communication containing delivery of the source code and the corresponding instructions, of any improvements or new versions that they may have made. Delivery to the CNES of these improvements or new versions made by the sub-licensees authorises the CNES to redistribute them under the same conditions as those provided for in this license.\r\n\r\nIt follows that the licensee, on the improvements or new versions made by himself or those made and communicated by his sub-licensees for which he himself will obtain the necessary transfer of rights, will grant the CNES free of charge and with no exclusive right, a right to use, reproduce, translate, modify and adapt, incorporate into another software and to redistribute free of charge or for a fee.\r\n\r\nLikewise, the licensee will take charge of the terms of authentication for these sub-licenses.\r\n\r\nFailure by the sub-licensees to comply with any one of the conditions stipulated at the transfer of rights will be subject, in the sub-licenses, to the same sanctions on the part of the licensee vis \u00e0 vis his sub-licensees as those liable to be applied by the CNES to the licensee.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the initial version of the \"OASIS\" software or any one of the translations thereof or new versions cannot be sold by the licensee without prior written agreement from the CNES.\r\n\r\nThe rights such as they are stipulated above are granted to the licensee on the distinct understanding that: \r\n\r\n\u00a7 it is essential to maintain the CNES copyright and the reference to this license that appears on each copy of the initial version of the \"OASIS\" software and the accompanying instructions but also on all the copies of each translation or new version or any software in which the \"OASIS\" software has been incorporated. \r\n\r\n\u00a7 the licensee will not use the \"OASIS\" software in any way that could damage the image of the CNES, notably its scientific and technical reputation. \r\n\r\n\u00a7 that the licensee, in the event of redistribution of the \"OASIS\" software will ensure that the source code and the corresponding instructions are delivered. \r\n\r\n\u00a7 that the licensee will return to the CNES, at the address indicated above, his agreement duly signed and dated concerning the terms of this license. In the event that the licensee fails to satisfy one of these first three conditions, the CNES could terminate this license without prior notice or indemnity of any kind. If the agreement concerning the terms of the license is not returned signed and dated, it does not and will not have existed. \r\n\r\n\u00a7 the licensee also undertakes to communicate to the CNES as soon as possible any improvement or new version of the \"OASIS\" software which he has made which is not of a sensitive nature for the industrial and commercial activity of the CNES. The licensee authorises the CNES to redistribute these improvements and new versions under the same conditions as those in this license with the exception of versions subject to a sales agreement from the CNES.\r\n\r\n\u00a7 Furthermore, the CNES declares that the \"OASIS\" software was not designed or developed with a view to designing, building or servicing nuclear or medical installations.\r\n\r\nConsequently the licensee undertakes not to use it to the ends put forward above and guarantees the CNES that neither he nor any third party to whom he may have redistributed the \"OASIS\" software will use it to these ends.\r\n\r\nGUARANTEE\r\n\r\nThe licensee uses the \"OASIS\" software as supplied, on an \"as is\" basis, at his own risk, without any guarantee of any kind by the CNES. The CNES is under no obligation to correct the bugs or any deficiencies of any nature in the \"OASIS\" software.\r\n\r\nAny guarantee, whatever the express or implicit conditions, any alleged marketing guarantee or guarantee against an action for infringement is excluded here. The CNES is not responsible for any damages sustained by the licensee that may result from the use, modification or distribution of the \"OASIS\" software or its derivative versions.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, the CNES is not responsible in any way for any loss of income, profit or data, or any direct or indirect damages liable to arise from using the software or because the latter is not operative, even if the CNES has been warned of the prospect of such damages.\r\n\r\nIn the event that the CNES has agreed for the licensee to market any version of the \"OASIS\" software, this agreement would give rise to special provisions.\r\n\r\nBy using the \"OASIS\" software, the user accepts the terms of the above license.\r\n\r\nIf you \"click\" now, this means that you accept all the conditions of this license.",

For legal purposes, this document is the license under which OpenContent is made available for use. \r\n\r\nThe original version of this document may be found at http:\/\/opencontent.org\/opl.shtml \r\n\r\nLICENSE \r\n\r\nTerms and Conditions for Copying, Distributing, and Modifying \r\n\r\nItems other than copying, distributing, and modifying the Content with which this license was distributed (such as using, etc.) are outside the scope of this license. \r\n\r\n1. You may copy and distribute exact replicas of the OpenContent (OC) as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of the OC a copy of this License along with the OC. You may at your option charge a fee for the media and\/or handling involved in creating a unique copy of the OC for use offline, you may at your option offer instructional support for the OC in exchange for a fee, or you may at your option offer warranty in exchange for a fee. You may not charge a fee for the OC itself. You may not charge a fee for the sole service of providing access to and\/or use of the OC via a network (e.g. the Internet), whether it be via the world wide web, FTP, or any other method. \r\n\r\n2. You may modify your copy or copies of the OpenContent or any portion of it, thus forming works based on the Content, and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions: \r\n\r\na) You must cause the modified content to carry prominent notices stating that you changed it, the exact nature and content of the changes, and the date of any change. \r\n\r\nb) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or in part contains or is derived from the OC or any part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this License, unless otherwise permitted under applicable Fair Use law. \r\n\r\nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the OC, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the OC, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it. Exceptions are made to this requirement to release modified works free of charge under this license only in compliance with Fair Use law where applicable. \r\n\r\n3. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to copy, distribute or modify the OC. These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by distributing or translating the OC, or by deriving works herefrom, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or translating the OC. \r\n\r\nNO WARRANTY \r\n\r\n4. BECAUSE THE OPENCONTENT (OC) IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE OC, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND\/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE OC \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK OF USE OF THE OC IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE OC PROVE FAULTY, INACCURATE, OR OTHERWISE UNACCEPTABLE YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY REPAIR OR CORRECTION. \r\n\r\n5. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MIRROR AND\/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE OC AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE OC, EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.",

If you use Open Source software in conjunction with the programs, you must ensure that your use does not: (i) create, or purport to create, obligations of us with respect to the Oracle programs; or (ii) grant, or purport to grant, to any third party any rights to or immunities under our intellectual property or proprietary rights in the Oracle programs. For example, you may not develop a software program using an Oracle program and an Open Source program where such use results in a program file(s) that contains code from both the Oracle program and the Open Source program (including without limitation libraries) if the Open Source program is licensed under a license that requires any \"modifications\" be made freely available. You also may not combine the Oracle program with programs licensed under the GNU General Public License (\"GPL\") in any manner that could cause, or could be interpreted or asserted to cause, the Oracle program or any modifications thereto to become subject to the terms of the GPL. \r\n\r\nEntire Agreement \r\nYou agree that this agreement is the complete agreement for the programs and licenses, and this agreement supersedes all prior or contemporaneous agreements or representations.

HISTORY OF THE SOFTWARE\r\n==========================\r\n\r\nPython was created in the early 1990s by Guido van Rossum at Stichting\r\nMathematisch Centrum (CWI) in the Netherlands as a successor of a\r\nlanguage called ABC.  Guido is Python's principal author, although it\r\nincludes many contributions from others.  The last version released\r\nfrom CWI was Python 1.2.  In 1995, Guido continued his work on Python\r\nat the Corporation for National Research Initiatives (CNRI) in Reston,\r\nVirginia where he released several versions of the software.  Python\r\n1.6 was the last of the versions released by CNRI.  In 2000, Guido and\r\nthe Python core development team moved to BeOpen.com to form the\r\nBeOpen PythonLabs team.  Python 2.0 was the first and only release\r\nfrom BeOpen.com.\r\n\r\nFollowing the release of Python 1.6, and after Guido van Rossum left\r\nCNRI to work with commercial software developers, it became clear that\r\nthe ability to use Python with software available under the GNU Public\r\nLicense (GPL) was very desirable.  CNRI and the Free Software\r\nFoundation (FSF) interacted to develop enabling wording changes to the\r\nPython license.  Python 1.6.1 is essentially the same as Python 1.6,\r\nwith a few minor bug fixes, and with a different license that enables\r\nlater versions to be GPL-compatible.  Python 2.1 is a derivative work\r\nof Python 1.6.1, as well as of Python 2.0.\r\n\r\nAfter Python 2.0 was released by BeOpen.com, Guido van Rossum and the\r\nother PythonLabs developers joined Digital Creations.  All\r\nintellectual property added from this point on, starting with Python\r\n2.1 and its alpha and beta releases, is owned by the Python Software\r\nFoundation (PSF), a non-profit modeled after the Apache Software\r\nFoundation.  See http:\/\/www.python.org\/psf\/ for more information about\r\nthe PSF.\r\n\r\nThanks to the many outside volunteers who have worked under Guido's\r\ndirection to make these releases possible.\r\n\r\n\r\nB.

All Python licenses, unlike the GPL, let you distribute\r\n    a modified version without making your changes open source.  The\r\n    GPL-compatible licenses make it possible to combine Python with\r\n    other software that is released under the GPL; the others don't.\r\n\r\n(2) According to Richard Stallman, 1.6.1 is not GPL-compatible,\r\n    because its license has a choice of law clause.  According to\r\n    CNRI, however, Stallman's lawyer has told CNRI's lawyer that 1.6.1\r\n    is \"not incompatible\" with the GPL.\r\n\r\nThanks to the many outside volunteers who have worked under Guido's\r\ndirection to make these releases possible.\r\n\r\n\r\nB.

License Grant. Subject to the following terms, Red Hat, Inc. (\"Red Hat\") grants to you (\"User\") a perpetual, worldwide license to the Programs pursuant to the GNU General Public License v.2. The Programs are either a modular operating system or an application consisting of hundreds of software components. With the exception of certain image files identified in Section 2 below, the license agreement for each software component is located in the software component's source code and permits User to run, copy, modify, and redistribute (subject to certain obligations in some cases) the software component, in both source code and binary code forms. This EULA pertains solely to the Programs and does not limit User's rights under, or grant User rights that supersede, the license terms of any particular component.\r\n\r\n2. Intellectual Property Rights. The Programs and each of their components are owned by Red Hat and others and are protected under copyright law and under other laws as applicable. Title to the Programs and any component, or to any copy, modification, or merged portion shall remain with the aforementioned, subject to the applicable license. The \"Red Hat\" trademark and the \"Shadowman\" logo are registered trademarks of Red Hat in the U.S. and other countries. This EULA does not permit User to distribute the Programs or their components using Red Hat's trademarks, regardless of whether the copy has been modified. User should read the information found at http:\/\/www.redhat.com\/about\/corporate\/trademark\/ before distributing a copy of the Programs. User may make a commercial redistribution of the Programs only if, (a) a separate agreement with Red Hat authorizing such commercial redistribution is executed or other written permission is granted by Red Hat or (b) User modifies any files identified as \"REDHAT-LOGOS\" to remove and replace all images containing the \"Red Hat\" trademark or the \"Shadowman\" logo. Merely deleting these files may corrupt the Programs.\r\n\r\n3. Limited Warranty. Except as specifically stated in this Section 3, a separate agreement with Red Hat, or a license for a particular component, to the maximum extent permitted under applicable law, the Programs and the components are provided and licensed \"as is\" without warranty of any kind, expressed or implied, including the implied warranties of merchantability, non-infringement or fitness for a particular purpose. Red Hat warrants that the media on which the Programs and the components are furnished will be free from defects in materials and manufacture under normal use for a period of 30 days from the date of delivery to User. Red Hat does not warrant that the functions contained in the Programs will meet User's requirements or that the operation of the Programs will be entirely error free, appear precisely as described in the accompanying documentation, or comply with regulatory requirements. This warranty extends only to the party that purchases services pertaining to the Programs from Red Hat or a Red Hat authorized distributor.\r\n\r\n4. Limitation of Remedies and Liability. To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, User's exclusive remedy under this EULA is to return any defective media within 30 days of delivery along with a copy of User's payment receipt and Red Hat, at its option, will replace it or refund the money paid by User for the media. To the maximum extent permitted under applicable law, neither Red Hat, any Red Hat authorized distributor, nor the licensor of any component provided to User under this EULA will be liable to User for any incidental or consequential damages, including lost profits or lost savings arising out of the use or inability to use the Programs or any component, even if Red Hat, such authorized distributor or licensor has been advised of the possibility of such damages. In no event shall Red Hat's liability, an authorized distributor's liability or the liability of the licensor of a component provided to User under this EULA exceed the amount that User paid to Red Hat under this EULA during the twelve months preceding the action.\r\n\r\n5. Export Control. As required by the laws of the United States and other countries, User represents and warrants that it: (a) understands that the Programs and their components may be subject to export controls under the U.S. Commerce Department's Export Administration Regulations (\"EAR\"); (b) is not located in a prohibited destination country under the EAR or U.S. sanctions regulations (currently Cuba, Iran, Iraq, North Korea, Sudan and Syria, subject to change as posted by the United States government); (c) will not export, re-export, or transfer the Programs to any prohibited destination or persons or entities on the U.S. Bureau of Industry and Security Denied Parties List or Entity List, or the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control list of Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons, or any similar lists maintained by other countries, without the necessary export license(s) or authorizations(s); (d) will not use or transfer the Programs for use in connection with any nuclear, chemical or biological weapons, missile technology, or military end-uses where prohibited by an applicable arms embargo, unless authorized by the relevant government agency by regulation or specific license; (e) understands and agrees that if it is in the United States and exports or transfers the Programs to eligible end users, it will, to the extent required by EAR Section 740.17(e), submit semi-annual reports to the Commerce Department's Bureau of Industry and Security, which include the name and address (including country) of each transferee; and (f) understands that countries including the United States may restrict the import, use, or export of encryption products (which may include the Programs and the components) and agrees that it shall be solely responsible for compliance with any such import, use, or export restrictions.\r\n\r\n6. Third Party Programs. Red Hat may distribute third party software programs with the Programs that are not part of the Programs. These third party programs are not required to run the Programs, are provided as a convenience to User, and are subject to their own license terms. The license terms either accompany the third party software programs or can be viewed at http:\/\/www.redhat.com\/licenses\/thirdparty\/eula.html. If User does not agree to abide by the applicable license terms for the third party software programs, then User may not install them. If User wishes to install the third party software programs on more than one system or transfer the third party software programs to another party, then User must contact the licensor of the applicable third party software programs.\r\n\r\n7. General. If any provision of this agreement is held to be unenforceable, that shall not affect the enforceability of the remaining provisions. This agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of New York and of the United States, without regard to any conflict of laws provisions. The rights and obligations of the parties to this EULA shall not be governed by the United Nations Convention on the International Sale of Goods.",

Distribution Obligations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3.1. Application of License. The Modifications which You create or to which You contribute are governed by the terms of this License, including without limitation Section 2.2. The Source Code version of Governed Code may be distributed only under the terms of this License or a future version of this License released under Section 6.1, and You must include a copy of this License with every copy of the Source Code You distribute. You may not offer or impose any terms on any Source Code version that alters or restricts the applicable version of this License or the recipients' rights hereunder. However, You may include an additional document offering the additional rights described in Section 3.5.\r\n\r\n\r\n3.2. Availability of Source Code. Any Modification which You create or to which You contribute must be made available in Source Code form under the terms of this License either on the same media as an Executable Code version or via an Electronic Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom you made an Executable Code version available; and if made available via an Electronic Distribution Mechanism, must remain available for at least twelve (12) months after the date it initially became available, or at least six (6) months after a subsequent version of that particular Modification has been made available to such recipients. You are responsible for ensuring that the Source Code version remains available even if the Electronic Distribution Mechanism is maintained by a third party.\r\n\r\n\r\n3.3. Description of Modifications. You must cause all Governed Code to which you contribute to contain a file documenting the changes You made to create that Governed Code and the date of any change. You must include a prominent statement that the Modification is derived, directly or indirectly, from Original Code provided by RSV and including the name of RSV in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in any notice in an Executable Code version or related documentation in which You describe the origin or ownership of the Governed Code.\r\n\r\n\r\n3.4. Intellectual Property Matters.\r\n\r\n3.4.1.\tThird Party Claims. If You have knowledge that a party claims an intellectual property right in particular functionality or code (or its utilization under this License), you must include a text file with the source code distribution titled \"LEGAL\" which describes the claim and the party making the claim in sufficient detail that a recipient will know whom to contact. If you obtain such knowledge after You make Your Modification available as described in Section 3.2, You shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies You make available thereafter and shall take other steps (such as notifying RSV and appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably calculated to inform those who received the Governed Code that new knowledge has been obtained. In the event that You are a Contributor, You represent that, except as disclosed in the LEGAL file, your Modifications are your original creations and, to the best of your knowledge, no third party has any claim (including but not limited to intellectual property claims) relating to your Modifications. You represent that the LEGAL file includes complete details of any license or other restriction associated with any part of your Modifications.\r\n\r\n3.4.2. Contributor APIs. If Your Modification is an application programming interface and You own or control patents which are reasonably necessary to implement that API, you must also include this information in the LEGAL file.\r\n\r\n\r\n3.5. Required Notices. You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source Code, and this License in any documentation for the Source Code, where You describe recipients' rights relating to Governed Code. If You created one or more Modification(s), You may add your name as a Contributor to the notice described in Exhibit A. If it is not possible to put such notice in a particular Source Code file due to its structure, then you must include such notice in a location (such as a relevant directory file) where a user would be likely to look for such a notice. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Governed Code. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of RSV or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear than any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify RSV and every Contributor for any liability incurred by RSV or such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.\r\n\r\n\r\n3.6. Distribution of Executable Code Versions. You may distribute Governed Code in Executable Code form only if the requirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that Governed Code, and if You include a prominent notice stating that the Source Code version of the Governed Code is available under the terms of this License, including a description of how and where You have fulfilled the obligations of Section 3.2. The notice must be conspicuously included in any notice in an Executable Code version, related documentation or collateral in which You describe recipients' rights relating to the Governed Code. You may distribute the Executable Code version of Governed Code under a license of Your choice, which may contain terms different from this License, provided that You are in compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the Executable Code version does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient's rights in the Source Code version from the rights set forth in this License. If You distribute the Executable Code version under a different license You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ from this License are offered by You alone, not by RSV or any Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify RSV and every Contributor for any liability incurred by RSV or such Contributor as a result of any such terms You offer.\r\n\r\n\r\n3.7. Larger Works. You may create a Larger Work by combining Governed Code with other code not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Governed Code.\r\n\r\n\r\n4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.\r\n\r\nIf it is impossible for You to comply with any of theterms of this License with respect to some or all of the Governed Code due to statute or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must be included in the LEGAL file described in Section 3.4 and must be included with all distributions of the Source Code. Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.\r\n\r\n\r\n5. Trademark Usage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n5.1.\tAdvertising Materials. All advertising materials mentioning features or use of the Governed Code must display the following acknowledgement: \"This product includes software developed by Ricoh Silicon Valley, Inc.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n5.2.\tEndorsements. The names \"Ricoh,\" \"Ricoh Silicon Valley,\" and \"RSV\" must not be used to endorse or promote Contributor Versions or Larger Works without the prior written permission of RSV.\r\n\r\n\r\n5.3.\tProduct Names. Contributor Versions and Larger Works may not be called \"Ricoh\" nor may the word \"Ricoh\" appear in their names without the prior written permission of RSV.\r\n\r\n\r\n6. Versions of the License.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n6.1. New Versions. RSV may publish revised and\/or new versions of the License from time to time. Each version will be given a distinguishing version number.\r\n\r\n\r\n6.2. Effect of New Versions. Once Governed Code has been published under a particular version of the License, You may always continue to use it under the terms of that version. You may also choose to use such Governed Code under the terms of any subsequent version of the License published by RSV. No one other than RSV has the right to modify the terms applicable to Governed Code created under this License.\r\n\r\n\r\n7. Disclaimer of Warranty.\r\n\r\nGOVERNED CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN \"AS IS\" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE GOVERNED CODE IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE GOVERNED CODE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY GOVERNED CODE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT RSV OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY GOVERNED CODE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.\r\n\r\n\r\n8. Termination.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n8.1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. All sublicenses to the Governed Code which are properly granted shall survive any termination of this License. Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License shall survive.\r\n\r\n\r\n8.2. If You initiate patent infringement litigation against RSV or a Contributor (RSV or the Contributor against whom You file such action is referred to as \"Participant\") alleging that:\r\n\r\n\r\n(a) such Participant's Original Code or Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted by such Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and\/or 2.2 of this License shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate prospectively, unless if within 60 days after receipt of notice You either: (i) agree in writing to pay Participant a mutually agreeable reasonable royalty for Your past and future use of the Original Code or the Modifications made by such Participant, or (ii) withdraw Your litigation claim with respect to the Original Code or the Contributor Version against such Participant. If within 60 days of notice, a reasonable royalty and payment arrangement are not mutually agreed upon in writing by the parties or the litigation claim is not withdrawn, the rights granted by Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and\/or 2.2 automatically terminate at the expiration of the 60 day notice period specified above.\r\n\r\n(b) any software, hardware, or device provided to You by the Participant, other than such Participant's Original Code or Contributor Version, directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any rights granted to You by such Participant under Sections 2.1(b) and 2.2(b) are revoked effective as of the date You first made, used, sold, distributed, or had made, Original Code or the Modifications made by that Participant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n8.3. If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant alleging that such Participant's Original Code or Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as by license or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses granted by such Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken into account in determining the amount or value of any payment or license.\r\n\r\n\r\n8.4. In the event of termination under Sections 8.1 or 8.2 above, all end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder prior to termination shall survive termination.\r\n\r\n\r\n9. Limitation of Liability.\r\n\r\nUNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL RSV, ANY CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF GOVERNED CODE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO YOU OR ANY OTHER PERSON FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THAT EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. TO THE EXTENT THAT ANY EXCLUSION OF DAMAGES ABOVE IS NOT VALID, YOU AGREE THAT IN NO EVENT WILL RSVS LIABILITY UNDER OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT EXCEED FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS ($5,000). THE GOVERNED CODE IS NOT INTENDED FOR USE IN CONNECTION WITH ANY NUCLER, AVIATION, MASS TRANSIT OR MEDICAL APPLICATION OR ANY OTHER INHERENTLY DANGEROUS APPLICATION THAT COULD RESULT IN DEATH, PERSONAL INJURY, CATASTROPHIC DAMAGE OR MASS DESTRUCTION, AND YOU AGREE THAT NEITHER RSV NOR ANY CONTRIBUTOR SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY OF ANY NATURE AS A RESULT OF ANY SUCH USE OF THE GOVERNED CODE.\r\n\r\n\r\n10. U.S. Government End Users.\r\n\r\nThe Governed Code is a \"commercial item,\" as that term is defined in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of \"commercial computer software\" and \"commercial computer software documentation,\" as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users acquire Governed Code with only those rights set forth herein.\r\n\r\n\r\n11. Miscellaneous.\r\n\r\nThis License represents the complete agreement concerning subject matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be governed by California law provisions (except to the extent applicable law, if any, provides otherwise), excluding its conflict-of-law provisions. The parties submit to personal jurisdiction in California and further agree that any cause of action arising under or related to this Agreement shall be brought in the Federal Courts of the Northern District of California, with venue lying in Santa Clara County, California. The losing party shall be responsible for costs, including without limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys fees and expenses. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, RSV may seek injunctive relief related to a breach of this Agreement in any court of competent jurisdiction. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not apply to this License.\r\n\r\n\r\n12. Responsibility for Claims.\r\n\r\nExcept in cases where another Contributor has failed to comply with Section 3.4, You are responsible for damages arising, directly or indirectly, out of Your utilization of rights under this License, based on the number of copies of Governed Code you made available, the revenues you received from utilizing such rights, and other relevant factors. You agree to work with affected parties to distribute responsibility on an equitable basis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nEXHIBIT A\r\n\r\n\"The contents of this file are subject to the Ricoh Source Code Public License Version 1.0 (the \"License\"); you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.

You can also distribute\r\n    unmodified parts of Vim, likewise unrestricted except that they must\r\n    include this license text.  You are also allowed to include executables\r\n    that you made from the unmodified Vim sources, plus your own usage\r\n    examples and Vim scripts.\r\n\r\nII) It is allowed to distribute a modified (or extended) version of Vim,\r\n    including executables and\/or source code, when the following four\r\n    conditions are met:\r\n    1) This license text must be included unmodified.\r\n    2) The modified Vim must be distributed in one of the following five ways:\r\n       a) If you make changes to Vim yourself, you must clearly describe in\r\n\t  the distribution how to contact you.  When the maintainer asks you\r\n\t  (in any way) for a copy of the modified Vim you distributed, you\r\n\t  must make your changes, including source code, available to the\r\n\t  maintainer without fee.  The maintainer reserves the right to\r\n\t  include your changes in the official version of Vim.  What the\r\n\t  maintainer will do with your changes and under what license they\r\n\t  will be distributed is negotiable.  If there has been no negotiation\r\n\t  then this license, or a later version, also applies to your changes.\r\n\tThe current maintainer is Bram Moolenaar <Bram@vim.org>. If this \r\n\t  changes it will be announced in appropriate places (most likely\r\n\t  vim.sf.net, www.vim.org and\/or comp.editors).  When it is completely\r\n\t  impossible to contact the maintainer, the obligation to send him\r\n\t  your changes ceases.  Once the maintainer has confirmed that he has\r\n\t  received your changes they will not have to be sent again.\r\n       b) If you have received a modified Vim that was distributed as\r\n\t  mentioned under a) you are allowed to further distribute it\r\n\t  unmodified, as mentioned at I).  If you make additional changes the\r\n\t  text under a) applies to those changes.\r\n       c) Provide all the changes, including source code, with every copy of\r\n\t  the modified Vim you distribute.  This may be done in the form of a\r\n\t  context diff.  You can choose what license to use for new code you\r\n\t  add.  The changes and their license must not restrict others from\r\n\t  making their own changes to the official version of Vim.\r\n       d) When you have a modified Vim which includes changes as mentioned\r\n\t  under c), you can distribute it without the source code for the\r\n\t  changes if the following three conditions are met:\r\n\t  - The license that applies to the changes permits you to distribute\r\n\t    the changes to the Vim maintainer without fee or restriction, and\r\n\t    permits the Vim maintainer to include the changes in the official\r\n\t    version of Vim without fee or restriction.\r\n\t  - You keep the changes for at least three years after last\r\n\t    distributing the corresponding modified Vim.  When the maintainer\r\n\t    or someone who you distributed the modified Vim to asks you (in\r\n\t    any way) for the changes within this period, you must make them\r\n\t    available to him.\r\n\t  - You clearly describe in the distribution how to contact you.  This\r\n\t    contact information must remain valid for at least three years\r\n\t    after last distributing the corresponding modified Vim, or as long\r\n\t    as possible.\r\n       e) When the GNU General Public License (GPL) applies to the changes,\r\n\t  you can distribute the modified Vim under the GNU GPL version 2 or\r\n\t  any later version.\r\n    3) A message must be added, at least in the output of the \":version\"\r\n       command and in the intro screen, such that the user of the modified Vim\r\n       is able to see that it was modified.  When distributing as mentioned\r\n       under 2)e) adding the message is only required for as far as this does\r\n       not conflict with the license used for the changes.\r\n    4) The contact information as required under 2)a) and 2)d) must not be\r\n       removed or changed, except that the person himself can make\r\n       corrections.\r\n\r\nIII) If you distribute a modified version of Vim, you are encouraged to use\r\n     the Vim license for your changes and make them available to the\r\n     maintainer, including the source code.  The preferred way to do this is\r\n     by e-mail or by uploading the files to a server and e-mailing the URL.\r\n     If the number of changes is small (e.g., a modified Makefile) e-mailing a\r\n     context diff will do.  The e-mail address to be used is\r\n<maintainer@vim.org> \r\n\r\nIV)  It is not allowed to remove this license from the distribution of the Vim\r\n     sources, parts of it or from a modified version.  You may use this\r\n     license for previous Vim releases instead of the license that they came\r\n     with, at your option.",

Contributions do not include additions to the Program which: (i) are separate modules of software distributed in conjunction with the Program under their own license agreement, and (ii) are not derivative works of the Program.\r\n\"Contributor\" means <OWNER> and any other entity that has Contributed a Contribution to the Program.\r\n\r\n\"Distributor\" means a Recipient that distributes the Program, modifications to the Program, or any part thereof.\r\n\r\n\"Licensed Patents\" mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone or when combined with the Program.\r\n\r\n\"Original Program\" means the original version of the software accompanying this Agreement as released by <OWNER>, including source code, object code and documentation, if any.\r\n\r\n\"Program\" means the Original Program and Contributions or any part thereof\r\n\r\n\"Recipient\" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement, including all Contributors.\r\n\r\n2. GRANT OF RIGHTS\r\nSubject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, and such derivative works, in source code and object code form.\r\nSubject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in source code and object code form. The patent license granted by a Contributor shall also apply to the combination of the Contribution of that Contributor and the Program if, at the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the Licensed Patents. The patent license granted by a Contributor shall not apply to (i) any other combinations which include the Contribution, nor to (ii) Contributions of other Contributors. No hardware per se is licensed hereunder.\r\nRecipient understands that although each Contributor grants the licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity. Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party patent license is required to allow Recipient to distribute the Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license before distributing the Program.\r\nEach Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright license set forth in this Agreement.\r\n3. REQUIREMENTS\r\nA. Distributor may choose to distribute the Program in any form under this Agreement or under its own license agreement, provided that:\r\n\r\nit complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement;\r\nif the Program is distributed in source code or other tangible form, a copy of this Agreement or Distributor's own license agreement is included with each copy of the Program; and\r\nif distributed under Distributor's own license agreement, such license agreement:\r\neffectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties and conditions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose;\r\neffectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits; and\r\nstates that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are offered by that Contributor alone and not by any other party.\r\nB. Each Distributor must include the following in a conspicuous location in the Program:\r\n\r\nCopyright (C) <YEAR>, <ORGANIZATION> and others. All Rights Reserved.\r\nC. In addition, each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its Contribution, if any, and indicate its consent to characterization of its additions and\/or changes as a Contribution, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent Recipients to identify the originator of the Contribution. Once consent is granted, it may not thereafter be revoked.\r\n\r\n4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION\r\nCommercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the Distributor who includes the Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner which does not create potential liability for Contributors. Therefore, if a Distributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering, such Distributor (\"Commercial Distributor\") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every Contributor (\"Indemnified Contributor\") against any losses, damages and costs (collectively \"Losses\") arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial Distributor in connection with its distribution of the Program in a commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial Distributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Distributor to control, and cooperate with the Commercial Distributor in, the defense and any related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such claim at its own expense.\r\n\r\nFor example, a Distributor might include the Program in a commercial product offering, Product X. That Distributor is then a Commercial Distributor. If that Commercial Distributor then makes performance claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are such Commercial Distributor's responsibility alone. Under this section, the Commercial Distributor would have to defend claims against the Contributors related to those performance claims and warranties, and if a court requires any Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Distributor must pay those damages.\r\n\r\n5. NO WARRANTY\r\nEXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN \"AS IS\" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement, including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.\r\n\r\n6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY\r\nEXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\r\n\r\n7. GENERAL\r\nIf any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.\r\n\r\nIf Recipient institutes patent litigation against a Contributor with respect to a patent applicable to software (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit), then any patent licenses granted by that Contributor to such Recipient under this Agreement shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed. In addition, if Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software or hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.\r\n\r\nAll Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable. However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement and any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and survive.\r\n\r\n<OWNER> may publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement from time to time. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing version number. The Program (including Contributions) may always be distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which it was received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is published, Contributor may elect to distribute the Program (including its Contributions) under the new version. No one other than <OWNER> has the right to modify this Agreement. Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual property of any Contributor under this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved.\r\n\r\nThis Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of <STATE> and the intellectual property laws of the United States of America. No party to this Agreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement more than one year after the cause of action arose. Each party waives its rights to a jury trial in any resulting litigation.",

As described below you may use\r\nthis licence for any software that you wish to distribute. \r\n\r\nIt may be particularly suitable if your software is TeX related (such\r\nas a LaTeX package file) but it may be used for any software, even if\r\nit is unrelated to TeX.\r\n\r\nTo use this license, the files of your distribution should have an\r\nexplicit copyright notice giving your name and the year, together\r\nwith a reference to this license.\r\n\r\nA typical example would be\r\n\r\n   %% pig.sty\r\n   %% Copyright 2001 M. Y. Name\r\n\r\n   % This program can redistributed and\/or modified under the terms\r\n   % of the LaTeX Project Public License Distributed from CTAN\r\n   % archives in directory macros\/latex\/base\/lppl.txt; either\r\n   % version 1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.\r\n\r\nGiven such a notice in the file, the conditions of this document would\r\napply, with:\r\n\r\n`The Program' referring to the software `pig.sty'  and \r\n`The Copyright Holder' referring to the person `M. Y. Name'.\r\n\r\nTo see a real example, see the file legal.txt which carries the\r\ncopyright notice for the base latex distribution.\r\n\r\nThis license gives terms under which files of The Program may be\r\ndistributed and modified. Individual files may have specific further\r\nconstraints on modification, but no file should have restrictions on\r\ndistribution other than those specified below. \r\nThis is to ensure that a distributor wishing to distribute a complete\r\nunmodified copy of The Program need only check the conditions in this\r\nfile, and does not need to check every file in The Program for extra\r\nrestrictions. If you do need to modify the distribution terms of some\r\nfiles, do not refer to this license, instead distribute The Program\r\nunder a different license. You may use the parts of the text of LPPL as\r\na model for your own license, but your license should not directly refer\r\nto the LPPL or otherwise give the impression that The Program is\r\ndistributed under the LPPL. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe LaTeX Project Public License\r\n================================\r\nTerms And Conditions For Copying, Distribution And Modification\r\n===============================================================\r\n\r\n\r\nWARRANTY\r\n========\r\n\r\nThere is no warranty for The Program, to the extent permitted by\r\napplicable law.  Except when otherwise stated in writing, The\r\nCopyright Holder provides The Program `as is' without warranty of any\r\nkind, either expressed or implied, including, but not limited to, the\r\nimplied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular\r\npurpose.  The entire risk as to the quality and performance of the\r\nprogram is with you.  Should The Program prove defective, you assume\r\nthe cost of all necessary servicing, repair or correction.\r\n\r\nIn no event unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing\r\nwill The Copyright Holder, or any of the individual authors named in\r\nthe source for The Program, be liable to you for damages, including\r\nany general, special, incidental or consequential damages arising out\r\nof any use of The Program or out of inability to use The Program\r\n(including but not limited to loss of data or data being rendered\r\ninaccurate or losses sustained by you or by third parties as a result\r\nof a failure of The Program to operate with any other programs), even\r\nif such holder or other party has been advised of the possibility of\r\nsuch damages.\r\n\r\n\r\nDISTRIBUTION\r\n============\r\n\r\nRedistribution of unchanged files is allowed provided that all files\r\nthat make up the distribution of The Program are distributed.\r\nIn particular this means that The Program has to be distributed\r\nincluding its documentation if documentation was part of the original\r\ndistribution.\r\n\r\nThe distribution of The Program will contain a prominent file\r\nlisting all the files covered by this license.\r\n\r\nIf you receive only some of these files from someone, complain!\r\n\r\nThe distribution of changed versions of certain files included in the\r\nThe Program, and the reuse of code from The Program, are allowed\r\nunder the following restrictions:\r\n\r\n * It is allowed only if the legal notice in the file does not\r\n   expressly forbid it.\r\n   See note below, under \"Conditions on individual files\".\r\n \r\n * You rename the file before you make any changes to it, unless the\r\n   file explicitly says that renaming is not required.  Any such changed\r\n   files must be distributed under a license that forbids distribution\r\n   of those files, and any files derived from them, under the names used\r\n   by the original files in the distribution of The Program.\r\n\r\n * You change any `identification string' in The Program to clearly \r\n   indicate that the file is not part of the standard system.\r\n\r\n * If The Program includes an `error report address' so that errors\r\n   may be reported to The Copyright Holder, or other specified\r\n   addresses, this address must be changed in any modified versions of\r\n   The Program, so that reports for files not maintained by the\r\n   original program maintainers are directed to the maintainers of the\r\n   changed files. \r\n\r\n * You acknowledge the source and authorship of the original version\r\n   in the modified file.\r\n\r\n * You also distribute the unmodified version of the file or\r\n   alternatively provide sufficient information so that the\r\n   user of your modified file can be reasonably expected to be\r\n   able to obtain an original, unmodified copy of The Program.\r\n   For example, you may specify a URL to a site that you expect\r\n   will freely provide the user with a copy of The Program (either\r\n   the version on which your modification is based, or perhaps a\r\n   later version).\r\n\r\n * If The Program is intended to be used with, or is based on, LaTeX,\r\n   then files with the following file extensions which have special\r\n   meaning in LaTeX Software, have special modification rules under the\r\n   license:\r\n \r\n    - Files with extension `.ins' (installation files): these files may\r\n      not be modified at all because they contain the legal notices\r\n      that are placed in the generated files.\r\n \r\n    - Files with extension `.fd' (LaTeX font definitions files): these\r\n      files are allowed to be modified without changing the name, but\r\n      only to enable use of all available fonts and to prevent attempts\r\n      to access unavailable fonts. However, modified files are not\r\n      allowed to be distributed in place of original files.\r\n \r\n    - Files with extension `.cfg' (configuration files): these files\r\n      can be created or modified to enable easy configuration of the\r\n      system.  The documentation in cfgguide.tex in the base LaTeX\r\n      distribution describes when it makes sense to modify or generate\r\n      such files.\r\n \r\n\r\nThe above restrictions are not intended to prohibit, and hence do\r\nnot apply to, the updating, by any method, of a file so that it\r\nbecomes identical to the latest version of that file in The Program.\r\n\r\n========================================================================\r\n\r\nNOTES\r\n=====\r\n\r\nWe believe that these requirements give you the freedom you to make\r\nmodifications that conform with whatever technical specifications you\r\nwish, whilst maintaining the availability, integrity and reliability of\r\nThe Program.  If you do not see how to achieve your goal whilst\r\nadhering to these requirements then read the document cfgguide.tex\r\nin the base LaTeX distribution for suggestions. \r\n\r\nBecause of the portability and exchangeability aspects of systems\r\nlike LaTeX, The LaTeX3 Project deprecates the distribution of\r\nnon-standard versions of components of LaTeX or of generally available\r\ncontributed code for them but such distributions are permitted under the\r\nabove restrictions.\r\n\r\nThe document modguide.tex in the base LaTeX distribution details\r\nthe reasons for the legal requirements detailed above.\r\nEven if The Program is unrelated to LaTeX, the argument in\r\nmodguide.tex may still apply, and should be read before\r\na modified version of The Program is distributed.\r\n\r\n\r\nConditions on individual files\r\n==============================\r\n\r\nThe individual files may bear additional conditions which supersede\r\nthe general conditions on distribution and modification contained in\r\nthis file. If there are any such files, the distribution of The\r\nProgram will contain a prominent file that lists all the exceptional\r\nfiles.\r\n\r\nTypical examples of files with more restrictive modification\r\nconditions would be files that contain the text of copyright notices.\r\n\r\n * The conditions on individual files differ only in the\r\n   extent of *modification* that is allowed.\r\n\r\n * The conditions on *distribution* are the same for all the files.\r\n   Thus a (re)distributor of a complete, unchanged copy of The Program\r\n   need meet only the conditions in this file; it is not necessary to\r\n   check the header of every file in the distribution to check that a\r\n   distribution meets these requirements.",

This license may be particularly\r\nsuitable if your work is TeX-related (such as a LaTeX package), but\r\nyou may use it with small modifications even if your work is unrelated\r\nto TeX.\r\n\r\nThe section `WHETHER AND HOW TO DISTRIBUTE WORKS UNDER THIS LICENSE',\r\nbelow, gives instructions, examples, and recommendations for authors\r\nwho are considering distributing their works under this license.\r\n\r\nThis license gives conditions under which a work may be distributed\r\nand modified, as well as conditions under which modified versions of\r\nthat work may be distributed.\r\n\r\nWe, the LaTeX3 Project, believe that the conditions below give you\r\nthe freedom to make and distribute modified versions of your work\r\nthat conform with whatever technical specifications you wish while\r\nmaintaining the availability, integrity, and reliability of\r\nthat work.  If you do not see how to achieve your goal while\r\nmeeting these conditions, then read the document `cfgguide.tex'\r\nand `modguide.tex' in the base LaTeX distribution for suggestions.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEFINITIONS\r\n===========\r\n\r\nIn this license document the following terms are used:\r\n\r\n   `Work'\r\n    Any work being distributed under this License.\r\n    \r\n   `Derived Work'\r\n    Any work that under any applicable law is derived from the Work.\r\n\r\n   `Modification' \r\n    Any procedure that produces a Derived Work under any applicable\r\n    law -- for example, the production of a file containing an\r\n    original file associated with the Work or a significant portion of\r\n    such a file, either verbatim or with modifications and\/or\r\n    translated into another language.\r\n\r\n   `Modify'\r\n    To apply any procedure that produces a Derived Work under any\r\n    applicable law.\r\n    \r\n   `Distribution'\r\n    Making copies of the Work available from one person to another, in\r\n    whole or in part.  Distribution includes (but is not limited to)\r\n    making any electronic components of the Work accessible by\r\n    file transfer protocols such as FTP or HTTP or by shared file\r\n    systems such as Sun's Network File System (NFS).\r\n\r\n   `Compiled Work'\r\n    A version of the Work that has been processed into a form where it\r\n    is directly usable on a computer system.  This processing may\r\n    include using installation facilities provided by the Work,\r\n    transformations of the Work, copying of components of the Work, or\r\n    other activities.  Note that modification of any installation\r\n    facilities provided by the Work constitutes modification of the Work.\r\n\r\n   `Current Maintainer'\r\n    A person or persons nominated as such within the Work.  If there is\r\n    no such explicit nomination then it is the `Copyright Holder' under\r\n    any applicable law.\r\n\r\n   `Base Interpreter' \r\n    A program or process that is normally needed for running or\r\n    interpreting a part or the whole of the Work.    \r\n    A Base Interpreter may depend on external components but these\r\n    are not considered part of the Base Interpreter provided that each\r\n    external component clearly identifies itself whenever it is used\r\n    interactively.  Unless explicitly specified when applying the\r\n    license to the Work, the only applicable Base Interpreter is a\r\n    \"LaTeX-Format\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONDITIONS ON DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\r\n===========================================\r\n\r\n1.  Activities other than distribution and\/or modification of the Work\r\nare not covered by this license; they are outside its scope.  In\r\nparticular, the act of running the Work is not restricted and no\r\nrequirements are made concerning any offers of support for the Work.\r\n\r\n2.  You may distribute a complete, unmodified copy of the Work as you\r\nreceived it.  Distribution of only part of the Work is considered\r\nmodification of the Work, and no right to distribute such a Derived\r\nWork may be assumed under the terms of this clause.\r\n\r\n3.  You may distribute a Compiled Work that has been generated from a\r\ncomplete, unmodified copy of the Work as distributed under Clause 2\r\nabove, as long as that Compiled Work is distributed in such a way that\r\nthe recipients may install the Compiled Work on their system exactly\r\nas it would have been installed if they generated a Compiled Work\r\ndirectly from the Work.\r\n\r\n4.  If you are the Current Maintainer of the Work, you may, without\r\nrestriction, modify the Work, thus creating a Derived Work.  You may\r\nalso distribute the Derived Work without restriction, including\r\nCompiled Works generated from the Derived Work.  Derived Works\r\ndistributed in this manner by the Current Maintainer are considered to\r\nbe updated versions of the Work.\r\n\r\n5.  If you are not the Current Maintainer of the Work, you may modify\r\nyour copy of the Work, thus creating a Derived Work based on the Work,\r\nand compile this Derived Work, thus creating a Compiled Work based on\r\nthe Derived Work.\r\n\r\n6.  If you are not the Current Maintainer of the Work, you may\r\ndistribute a Derived Work provided the following conditions are met\r\nfor every component of the Work unless that component clearly states\r\nin the copyright notice that it is exempt from that condition.  Only\r\nthe Current Maintainer is allowed to add such statements of exemption \r\nto a component of the Work. \r\n\r\n  a. If a component of this Derived Work can be a direct replacement\r\n     for a component of the Work when that component is used with the\r\n     Base Interpreter, then, wherever this component of the Work\r\n     identifies itself to the user when used interactively with that\r\n     Base Interpreter, the replacement component of this Derived Work\r\n     clearly and unambiguously identifies itself as a modified version\r\n     of this component to the user when used interactively with that\r\n     Base Interpreter.\r\n     \r\n  b. Every component of the Derived Work contains prominent notices\r\n     detailing the nature of the changes to that component, or a\r\n     prominent reference to another file that is distributed as part\r\n     of the Derived Work and that contains a complete and accurate log\r\n     of the changes.\r\n  \r\n  c. No information in the Derived Work implies that any persons,\r\n     including (but not limited to) the authors of the original version\r\n     of the Work, provide any support, including (but not limited to)\r\n     the reporting and handling of errors, to recipients of the\r\n     Derived Work unless those persons have stated explicitly that\r\n     they do provide such support for the Derived Work.\r\n\r\n  d. You distribute at least one of the following with the Derived Work:\r\n\r\n       1. A complete, unmodified copy of the Work; \r\n          if your distribution of a modified component is made by\r\n          offering access to copy the modified component from a\r\n          designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy\r\n          the Work from the same or some similar place meets this\r\n          condition, even though third parties are not compelled to\r\n          copy the Work along with the modified component;\r\n\r\n       2. Information that is sufficient to obtain a complete, unmodified\r\n          copy of the Work.\r\n\r\n7.  If you are not the Current Maintainer of the Work, you may\r\ndistribute a Compiled Work generated from a Derived Work, as long as\r\nthe Derived Work is distributed to all recipients of the Compiled\r\nWork, and as long as the conditions of Clause 6, above, are met with\r\nregard to the Derived Work.\r\n\r\n8.  The conditions above are not intended to prohibit, and hence do\r\nnot apply to, the modification, by any method, of any component so that it\r\nbecomes identical to an  updated version of that component of the Work as\r\nit is distributed by the Current Maintainer under Clause 4, above.\r\n\r\n9.  Distribution of the Work or any Derived Work in an alternative\r\nformat, where the Work or that Derived Work (in whole or in part) is\r\nthen produced by applying some process to that format, does not relax or\r\nnullify any sections of this license as they pertain to the results of\r\napplying that process.\r\n     \r\n10. a. A Derived Work may be distributed under a different license\r\n       provided that license itself honors the conditions listed in\r\n       Clause 6 above, in regard to the Work, though it does not have\r\n       to honor the rest of the conditions in this license.\r\n      \r\n    b. If a Derived Work is distributed under this license, that\r\n       Derived Work must provide sufficient documentation as part of\r\n       itself to allow each recipient of that Derived Work to honor the \r\n       restrictions in Clause 6 above, concerning changes from the Work.\r\n\r\n11. This license places no restrictions on works that are unrelated to\r\nthe Work, nor does this license place any restrictions on aggregating\r\nsuch works with the Work by any means.\r\n\r\n12.  Nothing in this license is intended to, or may be used to, prevent\r\ncomplete compliance by all parties with all applicable laws.\r\n\r\n\r\nNO WARRANTY\r\n===========\r\n\r\nThere is no warranty for the Work.  Except when otherwise stated in\r\nwriting, the Copyright Holder provides the Work `as is', without\r\nwarranty of any kind, either expressed or implied, including, but not\r\nlimited to, the implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for\r\na particular purpose.  The entire risk as to the quality and performance\r\nof the Work is with you.  Should the Work prove defective, you\r\nassume the cost of all necessary servicing, repair, or correction.\r\n\r\nIn no event unless agreed to in writing will the Copyright Holder, or\r\nany author named in the components of the Work, or any other party who\r\nmay distribute and\/or modify the Work as permitted above, be liable to\r\nyou for damages, including any general, special, incidental or\r\nconsequential damages arising out of any use of the Work or out of\r\ninability to use the Work (including, but not limited to, loss of\r\ndata, data being rendered inaccurate, or losses sustained by anyone as\r\na result of any failure of the Work to operate with any other\r\nprograms), even if the Copyright Holder or said author or said other\r\nparty has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\r\n\r\n\r\nMAINTENANCE OF THE WORK\r\n=======================\r\n\r\nThe Work has the status `author-maintained' if the Copyright Holder\r\nexplicitly and prominently states near the primary copyright notice in\r\nthe Work that the Work can only be maintained by the Copyright Holder\r\nor simply that is `author-maintained'.\r\n\r\nThe Work has the status `maintained' if there is a Current Maintainer\r\nwho has indicated in the Work that they are willing to receive error\r\nreports for the Work (for example, by supplying a valid e-mail\r\naddress). It is not required for the Current Maintainer to acknowledge\r\nor act upon these error reports.\r\n\r\nThe Work changes from status `maintained' to `unmaintained' if there\r\nis no Current Maintainer, or the person stated to be Current\r\nMaintainer of the work cannot be reached through the indicated means\r\nof communication for a period of six months, and there are no other\r\nsignificant signs of active maintenance.\r\n\r\nYou can become the Current Maintainer of the Work by agreement with\r\nany existing Current Maintainer to take over this role.\r\n\r\nIf the Work is unmaintained, you can become the Current Maintainer of\r\nthe Work through the following steps:\r\n\r\n 1.  Make a reasonable attempt to trace the Current Maintainer (and\r\n     the Copyright Holder, if the two differ) through the means of\r\n     an Internet or similar search.\r\n\r\n 2.  If this search is successful, then enquire whether the Work\r\n     is still maintained.\r\n\r\n  a. If it is being maintained, then ask the Current Maintainer\r\n     to update their communication data within one month.\r\n     \r\n  b. If the search is unsuccessful or no action to resume active\r\n     maintenance is taken by the Current Maintainer, then announce\r\n     within the pertinent community your intention to take over\r\n     maintenance.  (If the Work is a LaTeX work, this could be\r\n     done, for example, by posting to comp.text.tex.)\r\n\r\n 3a. If the Current Maintainer is reachable and agrees to pass\r\n     maintenance of the Work to you, then this takes effect\r\n     immediately upon announcement.\r\n     \r\n  b. If the Current Maintainer is not reachable and the Copyright\r\n     Holder agrees that maintenance of the Work be passed to you,\r\n     then this takes effect immediately upon announcement.  \r\n    \r\n 4.  If you make an `intention announcement' as described in 2b. above\r\n     and after three months your intention is challenged neither by\r\n     the Current Maintainer nor by the Copyright Holder nor by other\r\n     people, then you may arrange for the Work to be changed so as\r\n     to name you as the (new) Current Maintainer.\r\n     \r\n 5.  If the previously unreachable Current Maintainer becomes\r\n     reachable once more within three months of a change completed\r\n     under the terms of 3b) or 4), then that Current Maintainer must\r\n     become or remain the Current Maintainer upon request provided\r\n     they then update their communication data within one month.\r\n\r\nA change in the Current Maintainer does not, of itself, alter the fact\r\nthat the Work is distributed under the LPPL license.\r\n\r\nIf you become the Current Maintainer of the Work, you should\r\nimmediately provide, within the Work, a prominent and unambiguous\r\nstatement of your status as Current Maintainer.  You should also\r\nannounce your new status to the same pertinent community as\r\nin 2b) above.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHETHER AND HOW TO DISTRIBUTE WORKS UNDER THIS LICENSE\r\n======================================================\r\n\r\nThis section contains important instructions, examples, and\r\nrecommendations for authors who are considering distributing their\r\nworks under this license.  These authors are addressed as `you' in\r\nthis section.\r\n\r\nChoosing This License or Another License\r\n----------------------------------------\r\n\r\nIf for any part of your work you want or need to use *distribution*\r\nconditions that differ significantly from those in this license, then\r\ndo not refer to this license anywhere in your work but, instead,\r\ndistribute your work under a different license.  You may use the text\r\nof this license as a model for your own license, but your license\r\nshould not refer to the LPPL or otherwise give the impression that\r\nyour work is distributed under the LPPL.\r\n\r\nThe document `modguide.tex' in the base LaTeX distribution explains\r\nthe motivation behind the conditions of this license.  It explains,\r\nfor example, why distributing LaTeX under the GNU General Public\r\nLicense (GPL) was considered inappropriate.  Even if your work is\r\nunrelated to LaTeX, the discussion in `modguide.tex' may still be\r\nrelevant, and authors intending to distribute their works under any\r\nlicense are encouraged to read it.\r\n\r\nA Recommendation on Modification Without Distribution\r\n-----------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nIt is wise never to modify a component of the Work, even for your own\r\npersonal use, without also meeting the above conditions for\r\ndistributing the modified component.  While you might intend that such\r\nmodifications will never be distributed, often this will happen by\r\naccident -- you may forget that you have modified that component; or\r\nit may not occur to you when allowing others to access the modified\r\nversion that you are thus distributing it and violating the conditions\r\nof this license in ways that could have legal implications and, worse,\r\ncause problems for the community.  It is therefore usually in your\r\nbest interest to keep your copy of the Work identical with the public\r\none.  Many works provide ways to control the behavior of that work\r\nwithout altering any of its licensed components.\r\n\r\nHow to Use This License\r\n-----------------------\r\n\r\nTo use this license, place in each of the components of your work both\r\nan explicit copyright notice including your name and the year the work\r\nwas authored and\/or last substantially modified.  Include also a\r\nstatement that the distribution and\/or modification of that\r\ncomponent is constrained by the conditions in this license.\r\n\r\nHere is an example of such a notice and statement:\r\n\r\n  %% pig.dtx\r\n  %% Copyright 2003 M. Y. Name\r\n  %\r\n  % This work may be distributed and\/or modified under the\r\n  % conditions of the LaTeX Project Public License, either version 1.3\r\n  % of this license or (at your option) any later version.\r\n  % The latest version of this license is in\r\n  %   http:\/\/www.latex-project.org\/lppl.txt\r\n  % and version 1.3 or later is part of all distributions of LaTeX\r\n  % version 2003\/12\/01 or later.\r\n  %\r\n  % This work has the LPPL maintenance status \"maintained\".\r\n  % \r\n  % This Current Maintainer of this work is M. Y. Name.\r\n  %\r\n  % This work consists of the files pig.dtx and pig.ins\r\n  % and the derived file pig.sty.\r\n\r\nGiven such a notice and statement in a file, the conditions\r\ngiven in this license document would apply, with the `Work' referring\r\nto the three files `pig.dtx', `pig.ins', and `pig.sty' (the last being\r\ngenerated from `pig.dtx' using `pig.ins'), the `Base Interpreter'\r\nreferring to any \"LaTeX-Format\", and both `Copyright Holder' and\r\n`Current Maintainer' referring to the person `M. Y. Name'.\r\n\r\nTo prevent the Maintenance section of LPPL from allowing someone else\r\nto become the Current Maintainer without your agreement, you could\r\nchange \"maintained\" above into \"author-maintained\".\r\n\r\n\r\nImportant Recommendations\r\n-------------------------\r\n\r\n Defining What Constitutes the Work\r\n\r\n   The LPPL requires that distributions of the Work contain all the\r\n   files of the Work.  It is therefore important that you provide a\r\n   way for the licensee to determine which files constitute the Work.\r\n   This could, for example, be achieved by explicitly listing all the\r\n   files of the Work near the copyright notice of each file or by\r\n   using a line such as:\r\n\r\n    % This work consists of all files listed in manifest.txt.\r\n   \r\n   in that place.  In the absence of an unequivocal list it might be\r\n   impossible for the licensee to determine what is considered by you\r\n   to comprise the Work and, in such a case, the licensee would be\r\n   entitled to make reasonable conjectures as to which files comprise\r\n   the Work.",

This license may be particularly\r\nsuitable if your work is TeX-related (such as a LaTeX package), but\r\nyou may use it with small modifications even if your work is unrelated\r\nto TeX.\r\n\r\nThe section `WHETHER AND HOW TO DISTRIBUTE WORKS UNDER THIS LICENSE',\r\nbelow, gives instructions, examples, and recommendations for authors\r\nwho are considering distributing their works under this license.\r\n\r\nThis license gives conditions under which a work may be distributed\r\nand modified, as well as conditions under which modified versions of\r\nthat work may be distributed.\r\n\r\nWe, the LaTeX3 Project, believe that the conditions below give you\r\nthe freedom to make and distribute modified versions of your work\r\nthat conform with whatever technical specifications you wish while\r\nmaintaining the availability, integrity, and reliability of\r\nthat work.  If you do not see how to achieve your goal while\r\nmeeting these conditions, then read the document `cfgguide.tex'\r\nand `modguide.tex' in the base LaTeX distribution for suggestions.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEFINITIONS\r\n===========\r\n\r\nIn this license document the following terms are used:\r\n\r\n   `Work'\r\n    Any work being distributed under this License.\r\n    \r\n   `Derived Work'\r\n    Any work that under any applicable law is derived from the Work.\r\n\r\n   `Modification' \r\n    Any procedure that produces a Derived Work under any applicable\r\n    law -- for example, the production of a file containing an\r\n    original file associated with the Work or a significant portion of\r\n    such a file, either verbatim or with modifications and\/or\r\n    translated into another language.\r\n\r\n   `Modify'\r\n    To apply any procedure that produces a Derived Work under any\r\n    applicable law.\r\n    \r\n   `Distribution'\r\n    Making copies of the Work available from one person to another, in\r\n    whole or in part.  Distribution includes (but is not limited to)\r\n    making any electronic components of the Work accessible by\r\n    file transfer protocols such as FTP or HTTP or by shared file\r\n    systems such as Sun's Network File System (NFS).\r\n\r\n   `Compiled Work'\r\n    A version of the Work that has been processed into a form where it\r\n    is directly usable on a computer system.  This processing may\r\n    include using installation facilities provided by the Work,\r\n    transformations of the Work, copying of components of the Work, or\r\n    other activities.  Note that modification of any installation\r\n    facilities provided by the Work constitutes modification of the Work.\r\n\r\n   `Current Maintainer'\r\n    A person or persons nominated as such within the Work.  If there is\r\n    no such explicit nomination then it is the `Copyright Holder' under\r\n    any applicable law.\r\n\r\n   `Base Interpreter' \r\n    A program or process that is normally needed for running or\r\n    interpreting a part or the whole of the Work.    \r\n\r\n    A Base Interpreter may depend on external components but these\r\n    are not considered part of the Base Interpreter provided that each\r\n    external component clearly identifies itself whenever it is used\r\n    interactively.  Unless explicitly specified when applying the\r\n    license to the Work, the only applicable Base Interpreter is a\r\n    `LaTeX-Format' or in the case of files belonging to the \r\n    `LaTeX-format' a program implementing the `TeX language'.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONDITIONS ON DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\r\n===========================================\r\n\r\n1.  Activities other than distribution and\/or modification of the Work\r\nare not covered by this license; they are outside its scope.  In\r\nparticular, the act of running the Work is not restricted and no\r\nrequirements are made concerning any offers of support for the Work.\r\n\r\n2.  You may distribute a complete, unmodified copy of the Work as you\r\nreceived it.  Distribution of only part of the Work is considered\r\nmodification of the Work, and no right to distribute such a Derived\r\nWork may be assumed under the terms of this clause.\r\n\r\n3.  You may distribute a Compiled Work that has been generated from a\r\ncomplete, unmodified copy of the Work as distributed under Clause 2\r\nabove, as long as that Compiled Work is distributed in such a way that\r\nthe recipients may install the Compiled Work on their system exactly\r\nas it would have been installed if they generated a Compiled Work\r\ndirectly from the Work.\r\n\r\n4.  If you are the Current Maintainer of the Work, you may, without\r\nrestriction, modify the Work, thus creating a Derived Work.  You may\r\nalso distribute the Derived Work without restriction, including\r\nCompiled Works generated from the Derived Work.  Derived Works\r\ndistributed in this manner by the Current Maintainer are considered to\r\nbe updated versions of the Work.\r\n\r\n5.  If you are not the Current Maintainer of the Work, you may modify\r\nyour copy of the Work, thus creating a Derived Work based on the Work,\r\nand compile this Derived Work, thus creating a Compiled Work based on\r\nthe Derived Work.\r\n\r\n6.  If you are not the Current Maintainer of the Work, you may\r\ndistribute a Derived Work provided the following conditions are met\r\nfor every component of the Work unless that component clearly states\r\nin the copyright notice that it is exempt from that condition.  Only\r\nthe Current Maintainer is allowed to add such statements of exemption \r\nto a component of the Work. \r\n\r\n  a. If a component of this Derived Work can be a direct replacement\r\n     for a component of the Work when that component is used with the\r\n     Base Interpreter, then, wherever this component of the Work\r\n     identifies itself to the user when used interactively with that\r\n     Base Interpreter, the replacement component of this Derived Work\r\n     clearly and unambiguously identifies itself as a modified version\r\n     of this component to the user when used interactively with that\r\n     Base Interpreter.\r\n     \r\n  b. Every component of the Derived Work contains prominent notices\r\n     detailing the nature of the changes to that component, or a\r\n     prominent reference to another file that is distributed as part\r\n     of the Derived Work and that contains a complete and accurate log\r\n     of the changes.\r\n  \r\n  c. No information in the Derived Work implies that any persons,\r\n     including (but not limited to) the authors of the original version\r\n     of the Work, provide any support, including (but not limited to)\r\n     the reporting and handling of errors, to recipients of the\r\n     Derived Work unless those persons have stated explicitly that\r\n     they do provide such support for the Derived Work.\r\n\r\n  d. You distribute at least one of the following with the Derived Work:\r\n\r\n       1. A complete, unmodified copy of the Work; \r\n          if your distribution of a modified component is made by\r\n          offering access to copy the modified component from a\r\n          designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy\r\n          the Work from the same or some similar place meets this\r\n          condition, even though third parties are not compelled to\r\n          copy the Work along with the modified component;\r\n\r\n       2. Information that is sufficient to obtain a complete,\r\n          unmodified copy of the Work.\r\n\r\n7.  If you are not the Current Maintainer of the Work, you may\r\ndistribute a Compiled Work generated from a Derived Work, as long as\r\nthe Derived Work is distributed to all recipients of the Compiled\r\nWork, and as long as the conditions of Clause 6, above, are met with\r\nregard to the Derived Work.\r\n\r\n8.  The conditions above are not intended to prohibit, and hence do not\r\napply to, the modification, by any method, of any component so that it\r\nbecomes identical to an updated version of that component of the Work as\r\nit is distributed by the Current Maintainer under Clause 4, above.\r\n\r\n9.  Distribution of the Work or any Derived Work in an alternative\r\nformat, where the Work or that Derived Work (in whole or in part) is\r\nthen produced by applying some process to that format, does not relax or\r\nnullify any sections of this license as they pertain to the results of\r\napplying that process.\r\n     \r\n10. a. A Derived Work may be distributed under a different license\r\n       provided that license itself honors the conditions listed in\r\n       Clause 6 above, in regard to the Work, though it does not have\r\n       to honor the rest of the conditions in this license.\r\n      \r\n    b. If a Derived Work is distributed under a different license, that\r\n       Derived Work must provide sufficient documentation as part of\r\n       itself to allow each recipient of that Derived Work to honor the \r\n       restrictions in Clause 6 above, concerning changes from the Work.\r\n\r\n11. This license places no restrictions on works that are unrelated to\r\nthe Work, nor does this license place any restrictions on aggregating\r\nsuch works with the Work by any means.\r\n\r\n12.  Nothing in this license is intended to, or may be used to, prevent\r\ncomplete compliance by all parties with all applicable laws.\r\n\r\n\r\nNO WARRANTY\r\n===========\r\n\r\nThere is no warranty for the Work.  Except when otherwise stated in\r\nwriting, the Copyright Holder provides the Work `as is', without\r\nwarranty of any kind, either expressed or implied, including, but not\r\nlimited to, the implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a\r\nparticular purpose.  The entire risk as to the quality and performance\r\nof the Work is with you.  Should the Work prove defective, you assume\r\nthe cost of all necessary servicing, repair, or correction.\r\n\r\nIn no event unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing\r\nwill The Copyright Holder, or any author named in the components of the\r\nWork, or any other party who may distribute and\/or modify the Work as\r\npermitted above, be liable to you for damages, including any general,\r\nspecial, incidental or consequential damages arising out of any use of\r\nthe Work or out of inability to use the Work (including, but not limited\r\nto, loss of data, data being rendered inaccurate, or losses sustained by\r\nanyone as a result of any failure of the Work to operate with any other\r\nprograms), even if the Copyright Holder or said author or said other\r\nparty has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\r\n\r\n\r\nMAINTENANCE OF THE WORK\r\n=======================\r\n\r\nThe Work has the status `author-maintained' if the Copyright Holder\r\nexplicitly and prominently states near the primary copyright notice in\r\nthe Work that the Work can only be maintained by the Copyright Holder\r\nor simply that it is `author-maintained'.\r\n\r\nThe Work has the status `maintained' if there is a Current Maintainer\r\nwho has indicated in the Work that they are willing to receive error\r\nreports for the Work (for example, by supplying a valid e-mail\r\naddress). It is not required for the Current Maintainer to acknowledge\r\nor act upon these error reports.\r\n\r\nThe Work changes from status `maintained' to `unmaintained' if there\r\nis no Current Maintainer, or the person stated to be Current\r\nMaintainer of the work cannot be reached through the indicated means\r\nof communication for a period of six months, and there are no other\r\nsignificant signs of active maintenance.\r\n\r\nYou can become the Current Maintainer of the Work by agreement with\r\nany existing Current Maintainer to take over this role.\r\n\r\nIf the Work is unmaintained, you can become the Current Maintainer of\r\nthe Work through the following steps:\r\n\r\n 1.  Make a reasonable attempt to trace the Current Maintainer (and\r\n     the Copyright Holder, if the two differ) through the means of\r\n     an Internet or similar search.\r\n\r\n 2.

If the previously unreachable Current Maintainer becomes\r\n     reachable once more within three months of a change completed\r\n     under the terms of 3b) or 4), then that Current Maintainer must\r\n     become or remain the Current Maintainer upon request provided\r\n     they then update their communication data within one month.\r\n\r\nA change in the Current Maintainer does not, of itself, alter the fact\r\nthat the Work is distributed under the LPPL license.\r\n\r\nIf you become the Current Maintainer of the Work, you should\r\nimmediately provide, within the Work, a prominent and unambiguous\r\nstatement of your status as Current Maintainer.  You should also\r\nannounce your new status to the same pertinent community as\r\nin 2b) above.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHETHER AND HOW TO DISTRIBUTE WORKS UNDER THIS LICENSE\r\n======================================================\r\n\r\nThis section contains important instructions, examples, and\r\nrecommendations for authors who are considering distributing their\r\nworks under this license.  These authors are addressed as `you' in\r\nthis section.\r\n\r\nChoosing This License or Another License\r\n----------------------------------------\r\n\r\nIf for any part of your work you want or need to use *distribution*\r\nconditions that differ significantly from those in this license, then\r\ndo not refer to this license anywhere in your work but, instead,\r\ndistribute your work under a different license.  You may use the text\r\nof this license as a model for your own license, but your license\r\nshould not refer to the LPPL or otherwise give the impression that\r\nyour work is distributed under the LPPL.\r\n\r\nThe document `modguide.tex' in the base LaTeX distribution explains\r\nthe motivation behind the conditions of this license.  It explains,\r\nfor example, why distributing LaTeX under the GNU General Public\r\nLicense (GPL) was considered inappropriate.  Even if your work is\r\nunrelated to LaTeX, the discussion in `modguide.tex' may still be\r\nrelevant, and authors intending to distribute their works under any\r\nlicense are encouraged to read it.\r\n\r\nA Recommendation on Modification Without Distribution\r\n-----------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nIt is wise never to modify a component of the Work, even for your own\r\npersonal use, without also meeting the above conditions for\r\ndistributing the modified component.  While you might intend that such\r\nmodifications will never be distributed, often this will happen by\r\naccident -- you may forget that you have modified that component; or\r\nit may not occur to you when allowing others to access the modified\r\nversion that you are thus distributing it and violating the conditions\r\nof this license in ways that could have legal implications and, worse,\r\ncause problems for the community.  It is therefore usually in your\r\nbest interest to keep your copy of the Work identical with the public\r\none.  Many works provide ways to control the behavior of that work\r\nwithout altering any of its licensed components.\r\n\r\nHow to Use This License\r\n-----------------------\r\n\r\nTo use this license, place in each of the components of your work both\r\nan explicit copyright notice including your name and the year the work\r\nwas authored and\/or last substantially modified.  Include also a\r\nstatement that the distribution and\/or modification of that\r\ncomponent is constrained by the conditions in this license.\r\n\r\nHere is an example of such a notice and statement:\r\n\r\n  %% pig.dtx\r\n  %% Copyright 2005 M. Y. Name\r\n  %\r\n  % This work may be distributed and\/or modified under the\r\n  % conditions of the LaTeX Project Public License, either version 1.3\r\n  % of this license or (at your option) any later version.\r\n  % The latest version of this license is in\r\n  %   http:\/\/www.latex-project.org\/lppl.txt\r\n  % and version 1.3 or later is part of all distributions of LaTeX\r\n  % version 2005\/12\/01 or later.\r\n  %\r\n  % This work has the LPPL maintenance status `maintained'.\r\n  % \r\n  % The Current Maintainer of this work is M. Y. Name.\r\n  %\r\n  % This work consists of the files pig.dtx and pig.ins\r\n  % and the derived file pig.sty.\r\n\r\nGiven such a notice and statement in a file, the conditions\r\ngiven in this license document would apply, with the `Work' referring\r\nto the three files `pig.dtx', `pig.ins', and `pig.sty' (the last being\r\ngenerated from `pig.dtx' using `pig.ins'), the `Base Interpreter'\r\nreferring to any `LaTeX-Format', and both `Copyright Holder' and\r\n`Current Maintainer' referring to the person `M. Y. Name'.\r\n\r\nIf you do not want the Maintenance section of LPPL to apply to your\r\nWork, change `maintained' above into `author-maintained'.  \r\nHowever, we recommend that you use `maintained', as the Maintenance\r\nsection was added in order to ensure that your Work remains useful to\r\nthe community even when you can no longer maintain and support it\r\nyourself.\r\n\r\nDerived Works That Are Not Replacements\r\n---------------------------------------\r\n\r\nSeveral clauses of the LPPL specify means to provide reliability and\r\nstability for the user community. They therefore concern themselves\r\nwith the case that a Derived Work is intended to be used as a\r\n(compatible or incompatible) replacement of the original Work. If\r\nthis is not the case (e.g., if a few lines of code are reused for a\r\ncompletely different task), then clauses 6b and 6d shall not apply.\r\n\r\n\r\nImportant Recommendations\r\n-------------------------\r\n\r\n Defining What Constitutes the Work\r\n\r\n   The LPPL requires that distributions of the Work contain all the\r\n   files of the Work.  It is therefore important that you provide a\r\n   way for the licensee to determine which files constitute the Work.\r\n   This could, for example, be achieved by explicitly listing all the\r\n   files of the Work near the copyright notice of each file or by\r\n   using a line such as:\r\n\r\n    % This work consists of all files listed in manifest.txt.\r\n   \r\n   in that place.  In the absence of an unequivocal list it might be\r\n   impossible for the licensee to determine what is considered by you\r\n   to comprise the Work and, in such a case, the licensee would be\r\n   entitled to make reasonable conjectures as to which files comprise\r\n   the Work.\r\n",

Distribution Obligations.\r\n\r\n3.1. Application of License.\r\n\r\nThe Modifications which You create or to which You contribute are governed by the terms of this License, including without limitation Section 2.2. The Source Code version of Covered Code may be distributed only under the terms of this License or a future version of this License released under Section 6.1, and You must include a copy of this License with every copy of the Source Code You distribute. You may not offer or impose any terms on any Source Code version that alters or restricts the applicable version of this License or the recipients' rights hereunder. However, You may include an additional document offering the additional rights described in Section 3.5.\r\n\r\n3.2. Availability of Source Code.\r\n\r\nAny Modification which You create or to which You contribute must be made available in Source Code form under the terms of this License either on the same media as an Executable version or via an accepted Electronic Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom you made an Executable version available; and if made available via Electronic Distribution Mechanism, must remain available for at least twelve (12) months after the date it initially became available, or at least six (6) months after a subsequent version of that particular Modification has been made available to such recipients. You are responsible for ensuring that the Source Code version remains available even if the Electronic Distribution Mechanism is maintained by a third party.\r\n\r\n3.3. Description of Modifications.\r\n\r\nYou must cause all Covered Code to which You contribute to contain a file documenting the changes You made to create that Covered Code and the date of any change. You must include a prominent statement that the Modification is derived, directly or indirectly, from Original Code provided by the Initial Developer and including the name of the Initial Developer in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in any notice in an Executable version or related documentation in which You describe the origin or ownership of the Covered Code.\r\n\r\n3.4. Intellectual Property Matters\r\n\r\n(a) Third Party Claims\r\n\r\nIf Contributor has knowledge that a license under a third party's intellectual property rights is required to exercise the rights granted by such Contributor under Sections 2.1 or 2.2, Contributor must include a text file with the Source Code distribution titled \"LEGAL\" which describes the claim and the party making the claim in sufficient detail that a recipient will know whom to contact. If Contributor obtains such knowledge after the Modification is made available as described in Section 3.2, Contributor shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies Contributor makes available thereafter and shall take other steps (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably calculated to inform those who received the Covered Code that new knowledge has been obtained.\r\n\r\n(b) Contributor APIs\r\n\r\nIf Contributor's Modifications include an application programming interface and Contributor has knowledge of patent licenses which are reasonably necessary to implement that API, Contributor must also include this information in the LEGAL file.\r\n\r\n(c) Representations.\r\n\r\nContributor represents that, except as disclosed pursuant to Section 3.4 (a) above, Contributor believes that Contributor's Modifications are Contributor's original creation(s) and\/or Contributor has sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by this License.\r\n\r\n3.5. Required Notices.\r\n\r\nYou must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source Code. If it is not possible to put such notice in a particular Source Code file due to its structure, then You must include such notice in a location (such as a relevant directory) where a user would be likely to look for such a notice. If You created one or more Modification(s) You may add your name as a Contributor to the notice described in Exhibit A. You must also duplicate this License in any documentation for the Source Code where You describe recipients' rights or ownership rights relating to Covered Code. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Code. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear than any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.\r\n\r\n3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions.\r\n\r\nYou may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the requirements of Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4 and 3.5 have been met for that Covered Code, and if You include a notice stating that the Source Code version of the Covered Code is available under the terms of this License, including a description of how and where You have fulfilled the obligations of Section 3.2. The notice must be conspicuously included in any notice in an Executable version, related documentation or collateral in which You describe recipients' rights relating to the Covered Code. You may distribute the Executable version of Covered Code or ownership rights under a license of Your choice, which may contain terms different from this License, provided that You are in compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the Executable version does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient's rights in the Source Code version from the rights set forth in this License. If You distribute the Executable version under a different license You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ from this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such terms You offer.\r\n\r\n3.7. Larger Works.\r\n\r\nYou may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other code not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code.\r\n\r\n4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.\r\n\r\nIf it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License with respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must be included in the LEGAL file described in Section 3.4 and must be included with all distributions of the Source Code. Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.\r\n\r\n5. Application of this License.\r\n\r\nThis License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has attached the notice in Exhibit A and to related Covered Code.\r\n\r\n6. Versions of the License.\r\n\r\n6.1. New Versions\r\n\r\nNetscape Communications Corporation (\"Netscape\") may publish revised and\/or new versions of the License from time to time. Each version will be given a distinguishing version number.\r\n\r\n6.2. Effect of New Versions\r\n\r\nOnce Covered Code has been published under a particular version of the License, You may always continue to use it under the terms of that version. You may also choose to use such Covered Code under the terms of any subsequent version of the License published by Netscape. No one other than Netscape has the right to modify the terms applicable to Covered Code created under this License.\r\n\r\n6.3. Derivative Works\r\n\r\nIf You create or use a modified version of this License (which you may only do in order to apply it to code which is not already Covered Code governed by this License), You must (a) rename Your license so that the phrases \"Mozilla\", \"MOZILLAPL\", \"MOZPL\", \"Netscape\", \"MPL\", \"NPL\" or any confusingly similar phrase do not appear in your license (except to note that your license differs from this License) and (b) otherwise make it clear that Your version of the license contains terms which differ from the Mozilla Public License and Netscape Public License. (Filling in the name of the Initial Developer, Original Code or Contributor in the notice described in Exhibit A shall not of themselves be deemed to be modifications of this License.)\r\n\r\n7. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY\r\n\r\nCOVERED CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN \"AS IS\" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED CODE IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED CODE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED CODE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED CODE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.\r\n\r\n8. Termination\r\n\r\n8.1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. All sublicenses to the Covered Code which are properly granted shall survive any termination of this License. Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License shall survive.\r\n\r\n8.2. If You initiate litigation by asserting a patent infringement claim (excluding declatory judgment actions) against Initial Developer or a Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom You file such action is referred to as \"Participant\") alleging that:\r\n\r\nsuch Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted by such Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and\/or 2.2 of this License shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate prospectively, unless if within 60 days after receipt of notice You either: (i) agree in writing to pay Participant a mutually agreeable reasonable royalty for Your past and future use of Modifications made by such Participant, or (ii) withdraw Your litigation claim with respect to the Contributor Version against such Participant. If within 60 days of notice, a reasonable royalty and payment arrangement are not mutually agreed upon in writing by the parties or the litigation claim is not withdrawn, the rights granted by Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and\/or 2.2 automatically terminate at the expiration of the 60 day notice period specified above.\r\nany software, hardware, or device, other than such Participant's Contributor Version, directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any rights granted to You by such Participant under Sections 2.1(b) and 2.2(b) are revoked effective as of the date You first made, used, sold, distributed, or had made, Modifications made by that Participant.\r\n8.3. If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant alleging that such Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as by license or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses granted by such Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken into account in determining the amount or value of any payment or license.\r\n\r\n8.4. In the event of termination under Sections 8.1 or 8.2 above, all end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder prior to termination shall survive termination.\r\n\r\n9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY\r\n\r\nUNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED CODE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\r\n\r\n10. U.S. government end users\r\n\r\nThe Covered Code is a \"commercial item,\" as that term is defined in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of \"commercial computer software\" and \"commercial computer software documentation,\" as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Code with only those rights set forth herein.\r\n\r\n11. Miscellaneous\r\n\r\nThis License represents the complete agreement concerning subject matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be governed by California law provisions (except to the extent applicable law, if any, provides otherwise), excluding its conflict-of-law provisions. With respect to disputes in which at least one party is a citizen of, or an entity chartered or registered to do business in the United States of America, any litigation relating to this License shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Courts of the Northern District of California, with venue lying in Santa Clara County, California, with the losing party responsible for costs, including without limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not apply to this License.\r\n\r\n12. Responsibility for claims\r\n\r\nAs between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly, out of its utilization of rights under this License and You agree to work with Initial Developer and Contributors to distribute such responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing herein is intended or shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability.\r\n\r\n13. Multiple-licensed code\r\n\r\nInitial Developer may designate portions of the Covered Code as \"Multiple-Licensed\". \"Multiple-Licensed\" means that the Initial Developer permits you to utilize portions of the Covered Code under Your choice of the MPL or the alternative licenses, if any, specified by the Initial Developer in the file described in Exhibit A.\r\n\r\nExhibit A - Mozilla Public License.\r\n\r\n\"The contents of this file are subject to the Mozilla Public License\r\nVersion 1.1 (the \"License\"); you may not use this file except in\r\ncompliance with the License.

BY AGREEING TO THESE TERMS YOU ARE WARRANTING THAT YOU ARE A BUSINESS AND ARE NOT ACTING AS A CONSUMER.\r\n\r\n1. AGREEMENT\r\n\r\nIn this Agreement, \"the Product\" means the software product 'CCleaner'. \r\n\r\nThis Agreement is a legal agreement between you (as a business entity) and Piriform Limited of 17 Cavendish Square, London (\"Piriform\") in relation to the provision of support services for the  Product, which is licensed to you pursuant to a license agreement between Piriform and you from time to time (\"Licence\"). \r\n\r\nAll support services provided by Piriform to you, shall be on the terms and conditions set out in this Agreement. By purchasing the support services, you are deemed to agree to be bound by the terms and conditions of this Agreement.\r\n\r\n2. SUPPORT TERMS\r\n\r\nIn consideration of your payment of the applicable support fee, Piriform will endeavour to answer by email such number of your queries regarding the use or application of the Product as it deems reasonable. No representation or warranty is given that all queries will be responded to or responded to within a specified period of time. \r\n\r\nQueries should be submitted to Piriform using either of these methods:\r\n\u2022    http:\/\/support.piriform.com using such user account details as given to you by Piriform after your support account is enabled.  \r\n\u2022    Email direct to Piriform using such email address as given to you by Piriform after your support account is enabled.  \r\n\r\nUpon receipt of full payment of the support fee, a user account will be automatically enabled for you on http:\/\/support.piriform.com and you will be sent an email notification confirming activation of your user account and confirming your user account details. \r\n\r\nSupport fees and\/or any applicable renewal fees are non-refundable. \r\n\r\nPiriform warrants to you that the support services will be performed with reasonable care and skill and in accordance with applicable UK laws and regulations. All other conditions, warranties or other terms which may be implied or incorporated into this Agreement whether by statute, common law or otherwise are hereby excluded. \r\n\r\n3. LIMITS OF SUPPORT \r\n\r\nPiriform shall only provide support services in respect of the most current version of the Product. Piriform will regularly make available new versions of the Product for download to you from its website, subject to separate licence terms. \r\n\r\nPiriform shall only provide support services up to and in respect of the number of Installations of the Product that you have specified and paid for under this Agreement. You must purchase support services in respect of all Installations of the Product made by you; where you fail to do so this support agreement shall immediately terminate without notice, and without refund or liability to you.\r\n\r\nAn 'Installation' is defined as: \r\n(i) the installation of one copy of the Product on an individual physical device which does not have Virtualization Capability (as defined below); or \r\n(ii) each instance of the Product which is installed on a virtual machine operating on a device which has Virtualization Capability. \r\nWhere one copy of the Product is installed on a server but is accessible by multiple devices (whether physical or virtual), the Product shall be deemed to be installed both on the server and on each such device and each shall therefore be deemed an \"Installation\" for the purposes of this clause.  \r\n\r\n\"Virtualization Capability\" means making a single physical device appear to function as multiple virtual resources.\r\n\r\n\r\n4. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS\r\n\r\nPiriform warrants to you that to the best of its knowledge, the Product does not infringe the UK intellectual property rights of a third party.\r\n\r\nPiriform undertakes at its own expense to defend you against or, at its option, settle any claim or action brought against you alleging that your use or possession of the Product infringes the UK intellectual property rights of a third party. This paragraph 4 shall not apply where the claim or action in question is attributable to your use or possession of the Product other than in accordance with this Agreement or the Licence or use of a non-current release of the Product. This paragraph 4 is conditional upon you promptly giving written notice to Piriform specifying the nature of the claim or action and you not making any admission or compromise. This paragraph 4 constitutes your sole remedy and Piriform's only liability in respect of any such claims or actions.  \r\n\r\n5. YOUR OBLIGATIONS\r\n\r\nYou shall at all times:\r\n\u2022    keep full back up copies of all data;\r\n\u2022    co-operate with Piriform in providing the support services by providing any assistance or information that they require.\r\n\r\n6. TERM AND TERMINATION\r\n\r\nThis Agreement shall start on the date on which Piriform sends a confirmatory email to you confirming full payment of the support fees and issuing your user account details, and shall continue for a period of 1 year or for such other period as you may agree. \r\nIf you have purchased a yearly subscription for support, at the end of the year and any following year, this Agreement shall renew automatically for another year. Piriform (or its authorised agents or sub-contractors) will give you an opportunity to cancel your subscription in advance of the renewal date and will inform you of the renewal fees. Unless you notify Piriform by email before renewal that you do not want to renew, this Agreement will automatically renew.\r\n\r\nPiriform may terminate this Agreement at any time upon written notice to you. In such circumstances, Piriform will issue a pro-rate refund back onto the card originally used to pay. Furthermore, Piriform may terminate this Agreement immediately and without any liability to refund any payments to you if:\r\n\r\n\u2022    You commit a material or persistent beach of this Agreement;\r\n\u2022    You become insolvent or unable to pay your debts within the meaning of section 123 of the Insolvency Act 1986.\r\n\u2022    You fail to make any renewal payment. \r\n\r\nUpon termination of this Agreement your right to receive the support services shall automatically cease.\r\n\r\n7. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY\r\n\r\nPiriform's liability to you for losses suffered by you arising out of or in connection with this Agreement howsoever arising (including, without limitation, negligence) shall:\r\n\u2022    exclude all loss of profits, loss of data or any consequential, special or indirect losses\r\n\u2022    be limited each year in total to the charges paid by you under this Agreement in the year in which the liability arose. \r\n\r\nNothing in this Agreement limits Piriform's liability to you in the event of death or personal injury resulting from our negligence or for fraud. The provisions of this paragraph 7 shall survive the termination of this Agreement howsoever caused.\r\n\r\n8. GENERAL\r\n\r\n\u2022    If any part of this Agreement is found to be void and unenforceable it will not affect the validity of the remainder of this Agreement, which shall remain valid and enforceable according to its terms. \r\n\r\n\u2022    This Agreement may only be varied in writing and signed by an authorised representative of Piriform. \r\n\r\n\r\n\u2022    This Agreement is the entire agreement between you and us in respect of software support for the Product and supersedes any prior representations, undertakings or advertising and you acknowledge that in entering into this Agreement you have not relied on any statement, representation, advertising, assurance or warranty (whether made negligently or innocently) other than as expressly set out in this Agreement. \r\n\r\n\u2022    Piriform is entitled to transfer, sub-contract or assign any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement.\r\n\u2022    Piriform shall not be liable or responsible for any failure to perform or delay in performing its obligations under this Agreement that is caused by an event outside its reasonable control. \r\n\u2022    This Agreement and any dispute or claim arising out of or in connection with it or its subject matter or its formation (including non-contractual disputes or claims) shall be governed by and construed in accordance with English law and submitted to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the English courts.\r\nVersion 1.4.1",

HISTORY OF THE SOFTWARE\r\n==========================\r\n\r\nPython was created in the early 1990s by Guido van Rossum at Stichting\r\nMathematisch Centrum (CWI, see http:\/\/www.cwi.nl) in the Netherlands\r\nas a successor of a language called ABC.  Guido remains Python's\r\nprincipal author, although it includes many contributions from others.\r\n\r\nIn 1995, Guido continued his work on Python at the Corporation for\r\nNational Research Initiatives (CNRI, see http:\/\/www.cnri.reston.va.us)\r\nin Reston, Virginia where he released several versions of the\r\nsoftware.\r\n\r\nIn May 2000, Guido and the Python core development team moved to\r\nBeOpen.com to form the BeOpen PythonLabs team.  In October of the same\r\nyear, the PythonLabs team moved to Digital Creations (now Zope\r\nCorporation, see http:\/\/www.zope.com).  In 2001, the Python Software\r\nFoundation (PSF, see http:\/\/www.python.org\/psf\/) was formed, a\r\nnon-profit organization created specifically to own Python-related\r\nIntellectual Property.

All Python licenses, unlike the GPL, let you distribute\r\n    a modified version without making your changes open source.  The\r\n    GPL-compatible licenses make it possible to combine Python with\r\n    other software that is released under the GPL; the others don't.\r\n\r\n(2) According to Richard Stallman, 1.6.1 is not GPL-compatible,\r\n    because its license has a choice of law clause.  According to\r\n    CNRI, however, Stallman's lawyer has told CNRI's lawyer that 1.6.1\r\n    is \"not incompatible\" with the GPL.\r\n\r\nThanks to the many outside volunteers who have worked under Guido's\r\ndirection to make these releases possible.\r\n\r\n\r\nB.

(\u201cRN\u201d) has developed Specifications, Source Code implementations and Executables of the Helix DNA Code, and an associated TCK; and\r\n \r\nRN desires to license the Helix DNA Code to a large community to facilitate research, innovation and product development while maintaining compatibility of such products with the Helix DNA Code as delivered by RN;\r\n \r\nTherefore, RN makes available the Helix DNA Code, the Specifications, and the TCK available for Research and Development Use only under the following terms: \r\n \r\nLICENSE\r\n \r\n1.  Introduction. \r\n \r\nThe RealNetworks Community Source License \u2013 Research and Development Use (\u201cRCSL R&D\u201d or \u201cLicense\u201d) is a license to use the Source Code of certain portions of the Helix DNA Code, Specifications, and the TCK for research and development use only.   You (\u201cLicensee,\u201d as more specifically defined below) accept the terms of this License by downloading or using the Helix DNA Code, the Specifications, or the TCK, unless Licensee and RN have signed a license agreement that expressly supersedes this RCSL R&D. \r\n \r\nThis License does not include a license to access or modify the Source Code of the Real Format Client Code.  If Licensee desires the right to receive access to the Source Code of the Real Format Client Code for the purposes of porting and optimization, Licensee and RN may elect to execute a Real Format Source Code Porting and Optimization Agreement.\r\n \r\nThis License does not include a license to make Commercial Use of the Helix DNA Code or Real Format Client Code.  If Licensee desires a license for Commercial Use of the Helix DNA Code or Real Format Client Code, Licensee and RN may desire to execute the RealNetworks Community Source License - Commercial Use (\u201cRCSL Commercial\u201d) for the version of the Helix DNA Code or Real Format Client Code of which Licensee would like to make Commercial Use.  Once executed by Licensee and RN, the RCSL Commercial would supersede the terms of this License.\r\n \r\nCapitalized terms used in this License are defined in the Glossary attached to the end of this License.\r\n \r\n 2.  License Grants.\r\n \r\n 2.1  RN Grant to use Covered Code, Specifications, and TCK. \r\n \r\nSubject to Licensee\u2019s compliance with the terms of this License, RN grants to Licensee a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive license, to the extent of RN's Intellectual Property Rights covering the Covered Code, Specifications, and the TCK to do the following:\r\n \r\n(a) Research Use License.\r\n \r\n(i) use, reproduce and modify the Covered Code and Specifications to create Modifications and Reformatted Specifications for Research Use by Licensee;\r\n \r\n(ii) publish and display Covered Code and Specifications with, or as part of Modifications, as permitted under Section 3.1(b) below;\r\n \r\n(iii) reproduce and distribute copies of Covered Code to Licensees and students for Research Use by Licensee;\r\n \r\n(iv) compile, reproduce and distribute Covered Code in Executable form, and Reformatted Specifications to anyone for Research Use by Licensee; and\r\n \r\n(v) use the TCK to develop and test Covered Code.\r\n \r\n(b) Reservation of Rights.\r\n \r\nOther than the licenses expressly granted in this License, RN retains all right, title, and interest in Covered Code, Specifications and the TCK.\r\n \r\n(c)  TCK Use Restrictions.  \r\n \r\n                        Licensee may not create derivative works of the TCK or use the TCK to test any implementation of the Specifications except for the purpose of creating Compliant Covered Code.  Licensee may not publish Licensee\u2019s test results or make claims of comparative compatibility with respect to other implementations of the Specification. \r\n \r\n2.2 Licensee\u2019s Grants.\r\n \r\n(a) To Other Helix Licensees.  Licensee hereby grants to each other Helix Licensee a license to Licensee\u2019s Error Corrections and Shared Modifications, of the same scope and extent as RN's licenses under Section 2.1 (a) above relative to Research Use.\r\n \r\n(b) To RN.  Licensee hereby grant to RN a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual and irrevocable license, to the extent of Licensee\u2019s Intellectual Property Rights covering Licensee\u2019s Error Corrections, Shared Modifications and Reformatted Specifications, to use, reproduce, modify, display and distribute Licensee\u2019s Error Corrections, Shared Modifications and Reformatted Specifications, in any form, including the right to sublicense such rights through multiple tiers of distribution.\r\n \r\n(c) Other than the licenses expressly granted in Sections 2.2(a) and (b) above, and the restrictions set forth in Section 3.1 below, Licensee retains all right, title, and interest in Licensee\u2019s Error Corrections, Shared Modifications and Reformatted Specifications.\r\n \r\n2.3 Modifications by Helix Licensees. \r\n \r\nLicensee may use, reproduce, modify, display and distribute Error Corrections, Shared Modifications and Reformatted Specifications, obtained by Licensee under this License from any other Helix Licensee, to the same scope and extent as with Original Code, Upgraded Code and Specifications.\r\n \r\n2.4 Subcontracting. \r\n \r\n                        Licensee may deliver the Source Code of Covered Code to other Helix Licensees for the sole purpose of furnishing development services to Licensee in connection with Licensee\u2019s rights granted in this License, provided that Licensee does not enter a separate agreement with such Licensee that contains provisions inconsistent with the ownership and licensing requirements set forth in this License. \r\n \r\n3.  Requirements and Responsibilities.\r\n \r\n3.1 Research Use License. \r\n \r\nAs a condition of exercising the rights granted under Section 2.1(a) above, Licensee must comply with the following:\r\n \r\n(a) Licensee\u2019s Contributions.  All Error Corrections and Shared Modifications which Licensee creates are automatically subject to the licenses granted under Section 2.2 above.  Licensee is encouraged to license all of Licensee\u2019s other Modifications under Section 2.2 as Shared Modifications, but is not required to do so.  Licensee must notify RN of any errors in the Specifications.\r\n \r\n(b) Source Code Availability.  Licensee must provide all of Licensee\u2019s Error Corrections to RN as soon as reasonably practicable and, in any event, no later than when Licensee shares such Error Corrections with any other Helix Licensee.  RN may, at its discretion, post Source Code for Licensee\u2019s Error Corrections and Shared Modifications at the Helix Community Website.  \r\n \r\n(c) Notices.  All Error Corrections and Shared Modifications that Licensee creates or contributes to must include a file documenting the additions and changes Licensee made and the date of such additions and changes.  Licensee must also include the notice set forth in Attachment A-1 in the file header of any Error Correction or Shared Modification.  If it is not possible to put the notice in a particular Source Code file due to its structure, then Licensee must include the notice in a location (such as a relevant directory file), where a recipient would be most likely to look for such a notice.\r\n \r\n(d) Redistribution.\r\n \r\n(i) Source.  Covered Code may be distributed in Source Code form only to another Helix Licensee (except for students as provided below).  Licensee may not offer or impose any terms on any Covered Code that alter the rights, requirements, or responsibilities of such Helix Licensee.  Licensee may distribute Covered Code to students for use in connection with their course work and research projects undertaken at accredited educational institutions.  Such students need not be Helix Licensees, but must be given a copy of the notice set forth in Attachment A-3 and such notice must also be included in a file header or prominent location in the Source Code made available to such students.\r\n \r\n(ii) Executable.  Licensee may distribute Executable version(s) of Covered Code to Helix Licensees and other third parties only for the purpose of evaluation and comment in connection with Research Use by Licensee and under a license of Licensee\u2019s choice, but that limits use of such Executable version(s) of Covered Code only to that purpose.\r\n \r\n(iii) Modified Class, Interface and Package Naming.

Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, Licensor hereby grants You, effective on the date You accept this License (via downloading or using Covered Code or otherwise indicating your acceptance of this License), a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive copyright license, to the extent of Licensor's copyrights cover the Original Code, to do the following:\r\n\r\n2.1 You may reproduce, display, perform, modify and Deploy Covered Code, provided that in each instance:\r\n\r\n(a) You must retain and reproduce in all copies of Original Code the copyright and other proprietary notices and disclaimers of Licensor as they appear in the Original Code, and keep intact all notices in the Original Code that refer to this License;\r\n\r\n(b) You must include a copy of this License with every copy of Source Code of Covered Code and documentation You distribute, and You may not offer or impose any terms on such Source Code that alter or restrict this License or the recipients' rights hereunder, except as permitted under Section 6;\r\n\r\n(c) You must duplicate, to the extent it does not already exist, the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source Code of all Your Modifications, and cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that You changed the files and the date of any change;\r\n\r\n(d) You must make Source Code of all Your Externally Deployed Modifications publicly available under the terms of this License, including the license grants set forth in Section 3 below, for as long as you Deploy the Covered Code or twelve (12) months from the date of initial Deployment, whichever is longer. You should preferably distribute the Source Code of Your Deployed Modifications electronically (e.g. download from a web site); and\r\n\r\n(e) if You Deploy Covered Code in object code, executable form only, You must include a prominent notice, in the code itself as well as in related documentation, stating that Source Code of the Covered Code is available under the terms of this License with information on how and where to obtain such Source Code. You must also include the Object Code Notice set forth in Exhibit A in the \"about\" box or other appropriate place where other copyright notices are placed, including any packaging materials.\r\n\r\n2.2 You expressly acknowledge and agree that although Licensor and each Contributor grants the licenses to their respective portions of the Covered Code set forth herein, no assurances are provided by Licensor or any Contributor that the Covered Code does not infringe the patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity. Licensor and each Contributor disclaim any liability to You for claims brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, You hereby assume sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party patent license is required to allow You to make, use, sell, import or offer for sale the Covered Code, it is Your responsibility to acquire such license(s).\r\n\r\n2.3 Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, Licensor hereby grants You, effective on the date You accept this License (via downloading or using Covered Code or otherwise indicating your acceptance of this License), a worldwide, royalty-free, perpetual, non-exclusive patent license under Licensor's Applicable Patent Rights to make, use, sell, offer for sale and import the Covered Code, provided that in each instance you comply with the terms of this License.\r\n\r\n3. Your Grants. In consideration of, and as a condition to, the licenses granted to You under this License:\r\n\r\n(a) You grant to Licensor and all third parties a non-exclusive, perpetual, irrevocable, royalty free license under Your Applicable Patent Rights and other intellectual property rights owned or controlled by You, to make, sell, offer for sale, use, import, reproduce, display, perform, modify, distribute and Deploy Your Modifications of the same scope and extent as Licensor's licenses under Sections 2.1 and 2.2; and\r\n\r\n(b) You grant to Licensor and its subsidiaries a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free, perpetual and irrevocable license, under Your Applicable Patent Rights and other intellectual property rights owned or controlled by You, to make, use, sell, offer for sale, import, reproduce, display, perform, distribute, modify or have modified (for Licensor and\/or its subsidiaries), sublicense and distribute Your Modifications, in any form and for any purpose, through multiple tiers of distribution.\r\n\r\n(c) You agree not use any information derived from Your use and review of the Covered Code, including but not limited to any algorithms or inventions that may be contained in the Covered Code, for the purpose of asserting any of Your patent rights, or assisting a third party to assert any of its patent rights, against Licensor or any Contributor.\r\n\r\n4. Derivative Works. You may create a Derivative Work by combining Covered Code with other code not otherwise governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Derivative Work as an integrated product. In each such instance, You must make sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code or any portion thereof, including all Modifications.\r\n\r\n4.1 You must cause any Derivative Work that you distribute, publish or Externally Deploy, that in whole or in part contains or is derived from the Covered Code or any part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this License and no other license except as provided in Section 4.2. You also must make Source Code available for the Derivative Work under the same terms as Modifications, described in Sections 2 and 3, above.\r\n\r\n4.2 Compatible Source Licenses. Software modules that have been independently developed without any use of Covered Code and which contain no portion of the Covered Code, Modifications or other Derivative Works, but are used or combined in any way wtih the Covered Code or any Derivative Work to form a larger Derivative Work, are exempt from the conditions described in Section 4.1 but only to the extent that: the software module, including any software that is linked to, integrated with, or part of the same applications as, the software module by any method must be wholly subject to one of the Compatible Source Licenses. Notwithstanding the foregoing, all Covered Code must be subject to the terms of this License. Thus, the entire Derivative Work must be licensed under a combination of the RPSL (for Covered Code) and a Compatible Source License for any independently developed software modules within the Derivative Work. The foregoing requirement applies even if the Compatible Source License would ordinarily allow the software module to link with, or form larger works with, other software that is not subject to the Compatible Source License. For example, although the Mozilla Public License v1.1 allows Mozilla code to be combined with proprietary software that is not subject to the MPL, if MPL-licensed code is used with Covered Code the MPL-licensed code could not be combined or linked with any code not governed by the MPL. The general intent of this section 4.2 is to enable use of Covered Code with applications that are wholly subject to an acceptable open source license. You are responsible for determining whether your use of software with Covered Code is allowed under Your license to such software.\r\n\r\n4.3 Mere aggregation of another work not based on the Covered Code with the Covered Code (or with a work based on the Covered Code) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this License. If You deliver the Covered Code for combination and\/or integration with an application previously provided by You (for example, via automatic updating technology), such combination and\/or integration constitutes a Derivative Work subject to the terms of this License.\r\n\r\n5. Exclusions From License Grant. Nothing in this License shall be deemed to grant any rights to trademarks, copyrights, patents, trade secrets or any other intellectual property of Licensor or any Contributor except as expressly stated herein. No right is granted to the trademarks of Licensor or any Contributor even if such marks are included in the Covered Code. Nothing in this License shall be interpreted to prohibit Licensor from licensing under different terms from this License any code that Licensor otherwise would have a right to license. Modifications, Derivative Works and\/or any use or combination of Covered Code with other technology provided by Licensor or third parties may require additional patent licenses from Licensor which Licensor may grant in its sole discretion. No patent license is granted separate from the Original Code or combinations of the Original Code with other software or hardware.\r\n\r\n5.1. Trademarks. This License does not grant any rights to use the trademarks or trade names owned by Licensor (\"Licensor Marks\" defined in Exhibit C) or to any trademark or trade name belonging to any Contributor. No Licensor Marks may be used to endorse or promote products derived from the Original Code other than as permitted by the Licensor Trademark Policy defined in Exhibit C.\r\n\r\n6. Additional Terms. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations and\/or other rights consistent with the scope of the license granted herein (\"Additional Terms\") to one or more recipients of Covered Code. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf and as Your sole responsibility, and not on behalf of Licensor or any Contributor. You must obtain the recipient's agreement that any such Additional Terms are offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify, defend and hold Licensor and every Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by or claims asserted against Licensor or such Contributor by reason of any such Additional Terms.\r\n\r\n7. Versions of the License. Licensor may publish revised and\/or new versions of this License from time to time. Each version will be given a distinguishing version number. Once Original Code has been published under a particular version of this License, You may continue to use it under the terms of that version. You may also choose to use such Original Code under the terms of any subsequent version of this License published by Licensor. No one other than Licensor has the right to modify the terms applicable to Covered Code created under this License.\r\n\r\n8. NO WARRANTY OR SUPPORT. The Covered Code may contain in whole or in part pre-release, untested, or not fully tested works. The Covered Code may contain errors that could cause failures or loss of data, and may be incomplete or contain inaccuracies. You expressly acknowledge and agree that use of the Covered Code, or any portion thereof, is at Your sole and entire risk. THE COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\" AND WITHOUT WARRANTY, UPGRADES OR SUPPORT OF ANY KIND AND LICENSOR AND LICENSOR'S LICENSOR(S) (COLLECTIVELY REFERRED TO AS \"LICENSOR\" FOR THE PURPOSES OF SECTIONS 8 AND 9) AND ALL CONTRIBUTORS EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES AND\/OR CONDITIONS, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES AND\/OR CONDITIONS OF MERCHANTABILITY, OF SATISFACTORY QUALITY, OF FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OF ACCURACY, OF QUIET ENJOYMENT, AND NONINFRINGEMENT OF THIRD PARTY RIGHTS. LICENSOR AND EACH CONTRIBUTOR DOES NOT WARRANT AGAINST INTERFERENCE WITH YOUR ENJOYMENT OF THE COVERED CODE, THAT THE FUNCTIONS CONTAINED IN THE COVERED CODE WILL MEET YOUR REQUIREMENTS, THAT THE OPERATION OF THE COVERED CODE WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR-FREE, OR THAT DEFECTS IN THE COVERED CODE WILL BE CORRECTED. NO ORAL OR WRITTEN DOCUMENTATION, INFORMATION OR ADVICE GIVEN BY LICENSOR, A LICENSOR AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE OR ANY CONTRIBUTOR SHALL CREATE A WARRANTY. You acknowledge that the Covered Code is not intended for use in high risk activities, including, but not limited to, the design, construction, operation or maintenance of nuclear facilities, aircraft navigation, aircraft communication systems, or air traffic control machines in which case the failure of the Covered Code could lead to death, personal injury, or severe physical or environmental damage. Licensor disclaims any express or implied warranty of fitness for such uses.\r\n\r\n9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. TO THE EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL LICENSOR OR ANY CONTRIBUTOR BE LIABLE FOR ANY INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, INDIRECT OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS LICENSE OR YOUR USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE COVERED CODE, OR ANY PORTION THEREOF, WHETHER UNDER A THEORY OF CONTRACT, WARRANTY, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR STRICT LIABILITY), PRODUCTS LIABILITY OR OTHERWISE, EVEN IF LICENSOR OR SUCH CONTRIBUTOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES AND NOTWITHSTANDING THE FAILURE OF ESSENTIAL PURPOSE OF ANY REMEDY. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE LIMITATION OF LIABILITY OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. In no event shall Licensor's total liability to You for all damages (other than as may be required by applicable law) under this License exceed the amount of ten dollars ($10.00).\r\n\r\n10. Ownership. Subject to the licenses granted under this License, each Contributor retains all rights, title and interest in and to any Modifications made by such Contributor. Licensor retains all rights, title and interest in and to the Original Code and any Modifications made by or on behalf of Licensor (\"Licensor Modifications\"), and such Licensor Modifications will not be automatically subject to this License. Licensor may, at its sole discretion, choose to license such Licensor Modifications under this License, or on different terms from those contained in this License or may choose not to license them at all.\r\n\r\n11. Termination.\r\n\r\n11.1 Term and Termination. The term of this License is perpetual unless terminated as provided below. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate:\r\n\r\n(a) automatically without notice from Licensor if You fail to comply with any term(s) of this License and fail to cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of such breach;\r\n\r\n(b) immediately in the event of the circumstances described in Section 12.5(b); or\r\n\r\n(c) automatically without notice from Licensor if You, at any time during the term of this License, commence an action for patent infringement against Licensor (including by cross-claim or counter claim in a lawsuit);\r\n\r\n(d) upon written notice from Licensor if You, at any time during the term of this License, commence an action for patent infringement against any third party alleging that the Covered Code itself (excluding combinations with other software or hardware) infringes any patent (including by cross-claim or counter claim in a lawsuit).\r\n\r\n11.2 Effect of Termination. Upon termination, You agree to immediately stop any further use, reproduction, modification, sublicensing and distribution of the Covered Code and to destroy all copies of the Covered Code that are in your possession or control. All sublicenses to the Covered Code which have been properly granted prior to termination shall survive any termination of this License. Provisions which, by their nature, should remain in effect beyond the termination of this License shall survive, including but not limited to Sections 3, 5, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12.2 and 13. No party will be liable to any other for compensation, indemnity or damages of any sort solely as a result of terminating this License in accordance with its terms, and termination of this License will be without prejudice to any other right or remedy of any party.\r\n\r\n12. Miscellaneous.\r\n\r\n12.1 Government End Users. The Covered Code is a \"commercial item\" as defined in FAR 2.101. Government software and technical data rights in the Covered Code include only those rights customarily provided to the public as defined in this License. This customary commercial license in technical data and software is provided in accordance with FAR 12.211 (Technical Data) and 12.212 (Computer Software) and, for Department of Defense purchases, DFAR 252.227-7015 (Technical Data -- Commercial Items) and 227.7202-3 (Rights in Commercial Computer Software or Computer Software Documentation). Accordingly, all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Code with only those rights set forth herein.\r\n\r\n12.2 Relationship of Parties. This License will not be construed as creating an agency, partnership, joint venture or any other form of legal association between or among You, Licensor or any Contributor, and You will not represent to the contrary, whether expressly, by implication, appearance or otherwise.\r\n\r\n12.3 Independent Development. Nothing in this License will impair Licensor's right to acquire, license, develop, have others develop for it, market and\/or distribute technology or products that perform the same or similar functions as, or otherwise compete with, Modifications, Derivative Works, technology or products that You may develop, produce, market or distribute.\r\n\r\n12.4 Waiver; Construction. Failure by Licensor or any Contributor to enforce any provision of this License will not be deemed a waiver of future enforcement of that or any other provision. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter will not apply to this License.\r\n\r\n12.5 Severability. (a) If for any reason a court of competent jurisdiction finds any provision of this License, or portion thereof, to be unenforceable, that provision of the License will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible so as to effect the economic benefits and intent of the parties, and the remainder of this License will continue in full force and effect. (b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if applicable law prohibits or restricts You from fully and\/or specifically complying with Sections 2 and\/or 3 or prevents the enforceability of either of those Sections, this License will immediately terminate and You must immediately discontinue any use of the Covered Code and destroy all copies of it that are in your possession or control.\r\n\r\n12.6 Dispute Resolution. Any litigation or other dispute resolution between You and Licensor relating to this License shall take place in the Seattle, Washington, and You and Licensor hereby consent to the personal jurisdiction of, and venue in, the state and federal courts within that District with respect to this License. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded.\r\n\r\n12.7 Export\/Import Laws. This software is subject to all export and import laws and restrictions and regulations of the country in which you receive the Covered Code and You are solely responsible for ensuring that You do not export, re-export or import the Covered Code or any direct product thereof in violation of any such restrictions, laws or regulations, or without all necessary authorizations.\r\n\r\n12.8 Entire Agreement; Governing Law. This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof. This License shall be governed by the laws of the United States and the State of Washington.\r\n\r\nWhere You are located in the province of Quebec, Canada, the following clause applies: The parties hereby confirm that they have requested that this License and all related documents be drafted in English. Les parties ont exig\u00e9 que le pr\u00e9sent contrat et tous les documents connexes soient r\u00e9dig\u00e9s en anglais.\r\n\r\nEXHIBIT A.\r\n\r\n\"Copyright \u00a9 1995-2002 RealNetworks, Inc. and\/or its licensors.

By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users. This General Public License applies to most of the Free Software Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to using it. (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.) You can apply it to your programs, too.\r\n\r\nWhen we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.\r\n\r\nTo protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.\r\n\r\nFor example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\r\n\r\nWe protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and\/or modify the software.\r\n\r\nAlso, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free software. If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original authors' reputations.\r\n\r\nFinally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents. We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.\r\n\r\nThe precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.\r\n\r\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\r\n\r\n0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms of this General Public License. The \"Program\", below, refers to any such program or work, and a \"work based on the Program\" means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and\/or translated into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term \"modification\".) Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".\r\n\r\nActivities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Program (independent of having been made by running the Program). Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.\r\n\r\n1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License along with the Program.\r\n\r\nYou may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\r\n\r\n2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\r\n\r\na) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\r\nb) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.\r\nc) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when run, you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this License. (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on the Program is not required to print an announcement.)\r\nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\r\n\r\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on the Program.\r\n\r\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this License.\r\n\r\n3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:\r\n\r\na) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\r\nb) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\r\nc) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the program in object code or executable form with such an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)\r\nThe source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the executable. However, as a special exception, the source code distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable.\r\n\r\nIf distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code.\r\n\r\n4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.\r\n\r\n5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Program or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Program or works based on it.\r\n\r\n6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License.\r\n\r\n7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.\r\n\r\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.\r\n\r\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software distribution system, which is implemented by public license practices. Many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to the author\/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.\r\n\r\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of the rest of this License.\r\n\r\n8. If the distribution and\/or use of the Program is restricted in certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Program under this License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this License.\r\n\r\n9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and\/or new versions of the General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\r\n\r\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and \"any later version\", you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.\r\n\r\n10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.\r\n\r\nNO WARRANTY\r\n\r\n11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND\/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\r\n\r\n12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND\/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\r\n\r\nEND OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\r\n\r\nHow to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\r\n\r\nIf you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\r\n\r\nTo do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\r\n\r\none line to give the program's name and an idea of what it does.\r\nCopyright (C) yyyy  name of author\r\n\r\nThis program is free software; you can redistribute it and\/or\r\nmodify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License\r\nas published by the Free Software Foundation; either version 2\r\nof the License, or (at your option) any later version.\r\n\r\nThis program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\r\nbut WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\r\nMERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the\r\nGNU General Public License for more details.\r\n\r\nYou should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License\r\nalong with this program; if not, write to the Free Software\r\nFoundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301, USA.\r\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\r\n\r\nIf the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:\r\n\r\nGnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author\r\nGnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details\r\ntype `show w'.  This is free software, and you are welcome\r\nto redistribute it under certain conditions; type `show c' \r\nfor details.\r\nThe hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate parts of the General Public License. Of course, the commands you use may be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.\r\n\r\nYou should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your school, if any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if necessary. Here is a sample; alter the names:\r\n\r\nYoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright\r\ninterest in the program `Gnomovision'\r\n(which makes passes at compilers) written \r\nby James Hacker.\r\n\r\nsignature of Ty Coon, 1 April 1989\r\nTy Coon, President of Vice\r\nThis General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine library, you may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the library. If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General Public License instead of this License.",

Users are therefore encouraged to load and  test  the  Software's\r\nsuitability  as  regards  their  requirements  in  conditions  enabling  the\r\nsecurity of their systems and\/or data to be ensured and, more generally,  to\r\nuse and operate  it  in  the  same  conditions  as  regards  security.  This\r\nAgreement may be  freely  reproduced  and  published,  provided  it  is  not\r\naltered, and that no Articles are either added or removed herefrom.\r\n\r\nThis Agreement may apply to any or all software for which the holder of  the\r\neconomic rights decides to submit the operation thereof to its provisions.\r\n\r\n\r\nArticle 1  - DEFINITIONS\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\nFor the purposes of this Agreement, when the following expressions  commence\r\nwith a capital letter, they shall have the following meaning:\r\n\r\nAgreement: means this Licensing Agreement, and any or all of its  subsequent\r\nversions.\r\n\r\nSoftware: means the software in its Object  Code  and\/or  Source  Code  form\r\nand, where applicable, its documentation, \"as  is\"  at  the  time  when  the\r\nLicensee accepts the Agreement.\r\n\r\nInitial Software: means the Software in its Source Code and\/or  Object  Code\r\nform and, where applicable, its documentation, \"as is\" at the time  when  it\r\nis distributed for the first time under the  terms  and  conditions  of  the\r\nAgreement.\r\n\r\nModified  Software:  means  the  Software   modified   by   at   least   one\r\nContribution.\r\n\r\nSource Code: means all the Software's  instructions  and  program  lines  to\r\nwhich access is required so as to modify the Software.\r\n\r\nObject Code: means the binary files originating from the compilation of  the\r\nSource Code.\r\n\r\nHolder: means  the  holder  of  the  economic  copyright  over  the  Initial\r\nSoftware.\r\n\r\nLicensee(s): mean(s) the Software user(s) having accepted the Agreement.\r\n\r\nContributor: means a Licensee having made at least one Contribution.\r\n\r\nLicensor: means the Holder, or any or all other individual or legal  entity,\r\nthat distributes the Software under the Agreement.\r\n\r\nContributions: mean any or  all  modifications,  corrections,  translations,\r\nadaptations and\/or new functionalities integrated into the Software  by  any\r\nor all Contributor, and the Static Modules.\r\n\r\nModule: means a set of sources files  including  their  documentation  that,\r\nonce compiled in executable form, enables supplementary  functionalities  or\r\nservices to be developed in addition to those offered by the Software.\r\n\r\nDynamic Module: means any or all module, created by  the  Contributor,  that\r\nis independent of the Software, so that this module and the Software are  in\r\ntwo different executable forms that are  run  in  separate  address  spaces,\r\nwith one calling the other when they are run.\r\n\r\nStatic Module: means any or all  module,  created  by  the  Contributor  and\r\nconnected to the Software by a static link that  makes  their  object  codes\r\ninterdependent.

OVER THE INITIAL SOFTWARE\r\n\r\nThe Holder owns the economic rights over the Initial Software.  Any  or  all\r\nuse of the Initial Software is subject to  compliance  with  the  terms  and\r\nconditions under which the Holder has elected to distribute its work and  no\r\none shall be entitled to  and it shall have sole entitlement to  modify  the\r\nterms and conditions for the distribution of said Initial Software.\r\n\r\nThe Holder undertakes to maintain the distribution of the  Initial  Software\r\nunder the conditions of  the  Agreement,  for  the  duration  set  forth  in\r\narticle 4.2..\r\n\r\n6.2. OVER THE CONTRIBUTIONS\r\n\r\nThe intellectual property rights over the Contributions are attached to  the\r\nholder of the economic rights as designated by effective legislation.\r\n\r\n6.3. OVER THE DYNAMIC MODULES\r\n\r\nThe Licensee having  developed  a  Dynamic  Module  is  the  holder  of  the\r\nintellectual property rights over said Dynamic Module and is free to  choose\r\nthe agreement that shall govern its distribution.\r\n\r\n6.4. JOINT PROVISIONS\r\n\r\n6.4.1. The Licensee expressly undertakes:\r\n- not to remove, or modify, in  any  or  all  manner,  the  intellectual\r\n  property notices affixed to the Software;\r\n- to reproduce said notices, in an identical manner, in  the  copies  of\r\n  the Software.\r\n\r\n6.4.2. The Licensee undertakes not to directly or  indirectly  infringe  the\r\nintellectual property rights of the Holder and\/or Contributors and to  take,\r\nwhere applicable, vis-\u00e0-vis its staff,  any  or  all  measures  required  to\r\nensure respect for said intellectual property rights of  the  Holder  and\/or\r\nContributors.\r\n\r\n\r\nArticle 7  - RELATED SERVICES\r\n-----------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n7.1. Under no circumstances shall  the  Agreement  oblige  the  Licensor  to\r\nprovide technical assistance or maintenance services for the Software.\r\n\r\nHowever, the Licensor is entitled to offer  this  type  of  service. The\r\nterms  and  conditions  of  such  technical  assistance,  and\/or   such \r\nmaintenance, shall then be set forth in  a  separate  instrument.  Only  the\r\nLicensor offering said  maintenance  and\/or  technical  assistance  services\r\nshall incur liability therefor.\r\n\r\n7.2. Similarly, any or all Licensor  shall  be  entitled  to  offer  to  its\r\nLicensees, under its own responsibility, a  warranty,  that  shall  only  be\r\nbinding upon itself, for the  redistribution  of  the  Software  and\/or  the\r\nModified Software, under terms and conditions  that  it  shall  decide  upon\r\nitself. Said warranty,  and  the  financial  terms  and  conditions  of  its\r\napplication, shall be subject to a separate instrument executed between  the\r\nLicensor and the Licensee.\r\n\r\n\r\nArticle 8  - LIABILITY\r\n----------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n8.1. Subject to the provisions of Article 8.2, should the Licensor  fail  to\r\nfulfill all or part of its obligations  hereunder,  the  Licensee  shall  be\r\nentitled to claim compensation for the direct loss suffered that it is  able\r\nto justify, subject to providing proof of  negligence  by  the  Licensor  in\r\nquestion.\r\n\r\n8.2. The Licensor's liability is limited to the commitments made under  this\r\nLicensing Agreement and shall not be incurred as a result ,  in  particular:\r\n(i) of loss due the Licensee's total  or  partial  failure  to  fulfill  its\r\nobligations, (ii) direct or consequential loss due to the Software's use  or\r\nperformance that  is  suffered  by  the  Licensee,  when  the  latter  is  a\r\nprofessional  using  said  Software  for  professional  purposes  and  (iii)\r\nconsequential loss due to the Software's use  or  performance.  The  Parties\r\nexpressly agree that any or all pecuniary or business  loss  (i.e.  loss  of\r\ndata, loss  of  profits,  operating  loss,  loss  of  customers  or  orders,\r\nopportunity cost, any disturbance to business  activities)  or  any  or  all\r\nlegal proceedings instituted against the Licensee by a  third  party,  shall\r\nconstitute consequential loss and shall not provide entitlement  to  any  or\r\nall compensation from the Licensor.\r\n\r\n\r\nArticle 9  - WARRANTY\r\n---------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n9.1. The  Licensee  acknowledges  that  the  current  situation  as  regards\r\nscientific and  technical  know-how  at  the  time  when  the  Software  was\r\ndistributed did not enable all possible uses to be tested and verified,  nor\r\nfor the presence of any or all faults to be detected.

Grant of Rights.\r\n\r\n1.1. Effective upon Developer's payment of the initial license fee described in Section 2, CompuServe hereby grants to Developer a non-exclusive, worldwide: (a) license to use and exploit GIF(SM) to make, have made, use and sell Products solely within the Field of Use; and (b) sublicense to use and exploit the Licensed Patent to make, have made, use and sell Products solely within the Field of Use.\r\n\r\n1.2. CompuServe will provide Developer with a single copy of the most recent specification for GIF(SM) and any updates to such specification that are released by CompuServe during the term of this Agreement. Once an updated version of the GIF(SM) specification has been released by CompuServe, Developer should incorporate the updates contained in the new specification into its Products as part of Developer's ordinary release cycle.\r\n\r\n1.3. Developer understands that CompuServe and Unysis Corporation are the owners of all patents, copyrights, service marks and other intellectual property embodied in the Licensed Technology. In connection with its use of the Licensed Technology, Developer shall take all steps reasonably required by CompuServe and\/or Unysis Corporation to acknowledge and protect their respective ownership interests in the patents, copyrights, service marks and other intellectual property interests embodied in the Licensed Technology. Developer further agrees not to take any action that would impair the respective interests of CompuServe and\/or Unysis Corporation in the Licensed Technology.\r\n\r\n1.4. Developer may not use, copy, modify or distribute the GIF(SM) specification, except as expressly permitted by CompuServe. Developer may make three copies of the GIF(SM) specification for back-up purposes only, provided CompuServe's service mark, copyright and other notices and legends are included in such copy. Developer shall not alter or delete any of the notices or legends contained in the GIFSM specification and any updates thereto. Developer agrees to provide the following notice on Products or in any Product documentation: \"LZW compression and decompression methods are licensed under Unysis Corporation's U.S. Patent 4,558,302 and equivalent foreign patents. Additional technology embodied in GIF(SM) is licensed from CompuServe Incorporated. Graphics Interchange Format and GIF are service marks of CompuServe Incorporated.\"\r\n\r\n1.5. Developer shall not grant any customer the right to use a Product until such customer has been registered by Developer as a user of the Product and customer's rights to use such Product are governed by an agreement with Developer providing that (a) the customer's use of such Product will be primarily for accessing the CompuServe Information Service and for manipulating and viewing data received through the CompuServe Information Service, and (b) the customer will not alter, enhance or redistribute any Product.\r\n\r\n1.6. This Agreement does not provide Developer with title to or ownership of the Licensed Technology or any service mark of CompuServe, but only the license granted herein. Developer may only grant its customers a limited right to use Products.\r\n\r\nSection 2. License Fees.\r\n\r\n2.1. In payment for the licenses granted herein, Developer shall pay CompuServe a one-time initial license fee of $ 1.00 which is due in full upon the execution of this Agreement and a fee per Disposition equal to the greater of (a) 1.5 percent of the selling price per Disposition or (b) $.15 per Disposition.

Quarterly periods may be defined at CompuServe's discretion.\r\n\r\n2.2. Developer is solely responsible for payment of any taxes resulting from Developer's use of the Licensed Technology, except for taxes based on the income of CompuServe or Unysis Corporation. Developer agrees to hold CompuServe harmless from all claims and liability arising from Developer's failure to report or pay such taxes. This paragraph shall survive any termination of this Agreement.\r\n\r\nSection 3. New Products.\r\n\r\nDeveloper shall have the right to add additional Products solely within the Field of Use by providing notice to CompuServe of the existence of each new Product at the time such new Product is first offered to Developer's customers.\r\n\r\nSection 4. Reports.\r\n\r\nDeveloper shall keep adequate records to accurately determine the payments due under this Agreement. Each payment hereunder shall be made and accompanied by a report in such manner and form as requested by CompuServe setting forth the number of Dispositions of each Product occurring hereunder and any other information reasonably necessary to calculate payments due hereunder. Developer shall not enter into any arrangement under which copies of Products will be prepared or the Licensed Technology used, unless Developer has taken steps to ensure that it can account for and pay the royalties required hereunder.\r\n\r\nSection 5. Audits.\r\n\r\nCompuServe shall have the right, no more than once during any calendar year, to have an independent certified public accountant inspect the relevant records of Developer on seven business days notice and during regular business hours to verify the reports and payments required to be made hereunder. Should an underpayment in excess of 10 percent be discovered, Developer shall pay the cost of the audit. In any event, Developer shall promptly pay any underpayment together with interest at the annual rate of 12 percent.\r\n\r\nSection 6. Assignment.\r\n\r\nThis Agreement and the licenses granted herein may not be assigned by Developer without the prior written consent of CompuServe.\r\n\r\nSection 7.

Distribution Obligations. \r\n3.1. Application of License. The Modifications which You create or to which You contribute are governed by the terms of this License, including without limitation Section 2.2. The Source Code version of Covered Code may be distributed only under the terms of this License or a future version of this License released under Section 6.1, and You must include a copy of this License with every copy of the Source Code You distribute. You may not offer or impose any terms on any Source Code version that alters or restricts the applicable version of this License or the recipients' rights hereunder. However, You may include an additional document offering the additional rights described in Section 3.5. \r\n3.2. Availability of Source Code. Any Modification which You create or to which You contribute must be made available in Source Code form under the terms of this License either on the same media as an Executable version or via an accepted Electronic Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom you made an Executable version available; and if made available via Electronic Distribution Mechanism, must remain available for at least twelve (12) months after the date it initially became available, or at least six (6) months after a subsequent version of that particular Modification has been made available to such recipients. You are responsible for ensuring that the Source Code version remains available even if the Electronic Distribution Mechanism is maintained by a third party. \r\n3.3. Description of Modifications. You must cause all Covered Code to which You contribute to contain a file documenting the changes You made to create that Covered Code and the date of any change. You must include a prominent statement that the Modification is derived, directly or indirectly, from Original Code provided by the Initial Developer and including the name of the Initial Developer in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in any notice in an Executable version or related documentation in which You describe the origin or ownership of the Covered Code. \r\n3.4. Intellectual Property Matters\r\n(a) Third Party Claims.\r\nIf Contributor has knowledge that a license under a third party's intellectual property rights is required to exercise the rights granted by such Contributor under Sections 2.1 or 2.2, Contributor must include a text file with the Source Code distribution titled \"LEGAL\" which describes the claim and the party making the claim in sufficient detail that a recipient will know whom to contact. If Contributor obtains such knowledge after the Modification is made available as described in Section 3.2, Contributor shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies Contributor makes available thereafter and shall take other steps (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably calculated to inform those who received the Covered Code that new knowledge has been obtained. \r\n(b) Contributor APIs. \r\nIf Contributor's Modifications include an application programming interface and Contributor has knowledge of patent licenses which are reasonably necessary to implement that API, Contributor must also include this information in the LEGAL file. \r\n(c) Representations.\r\nContributor represents that, except as disclosed pursuant to Section 3.4(a) above, Contributor believes that Contributor's Modifications are Contributor's original creation(s) and\/or Contributor has sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by this License. \r\n3.5. Required Notices.\r\nYou must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source Code. If it is not possible to put such notice in a particular Source Code file due to its structure, then You must include such notice in a location (such as a relevant directory) where a user would be likely to look for such a notice. If You created one or more Modification(s) You may add your name as a Contributor to the notice described in Exhibit A. You must also duplicate this License in any documentation for the Source Code where You describe recipients' rights or ownership rights relating to Covered Code. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Code. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear than any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer. \r\n3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions.\r\nYou may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the requirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered Code, and if You include a notice stating that the Source Code version of the Covered Code is available under the terms of this License, including a description of how and where You have fulfilled the obligations of Section 3.2. The notice must be conspicuously included in any notice in an Executable version, related documentation or collateral in which You describe recipients' rights relating to the Covered Code. You may distribute the Executable version of Covered Code or ownership rights under a license of Your choice, which may contain terms different from this License, provided that You are in compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the Executable version does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient's rights in the Source Code version from the rights set forth in this License. If You distribute the Executable version under a different license You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ from this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such terms You offer. \r\n3.7. Larger Works.\r\nYou may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other code not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code. 4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.\r\nIf it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License with respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must be included in the LEGAL file described in Section 3.4 and must be included with all distributions of the Source Code. Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it. \r\n5. Application of this License. \r\nThis License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has attached the notice in Exhibit A and to related Covered Code. \r\n6. Versions of the License. \r\n6.1. New Versions.\r\nNetizen Pty Ltd (\"Netizen \") may publish revised and\/or new versions of the License from time to time. Each version will be given a distinguishing version number. \r\n6.2. Effect of New Versions.\r\nOnce Covered Code has been published under a particular version of the License, You may always continue to use it under the terms of that version. You may also choose to use such Covered Code under the terms of any subsequent version of the License published by Netizen. No one other than Netizen has the right to modify the terms applicable to Covered Code created under this License. \r\n6.3. Derivative Works. \r\nIf You create or use a modified version of this License (which you may only do in order to apply it to code which is not already Covered Code governed by this License), You must (a) rename Your license so that the phrases \"Netizen\", \"NOSL\" or any confusingly similar phrase do not appear in your license (except to note that your license differs from this License) and (b) otherwise make it clear that Your version of the license contains terms which differ from the Netizen Open Source License and Xen Open Source License. (Filling in the name of the Initial Developer, Original Code or Contributor in the notice described in Exhibit A shall not of themselves be deemed to be modifications of this License.) \r\n7. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.\r\nCOVERED CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN \"AS IS\" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED CODE IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED CODE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED CODE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED CODE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER. \r\n7.1 To the extent permitted by law and except as expressly provided to the contrary in this Agreement, all warranties whether express, implied, statutory or otherwise, relating in any way to the subject matter of this Agreement or to this Agreement generally, are excluded. Where legislation implies in this Agreement any condition or warranty and that legislation avoids or prohibits provisions in a contract excluding or modifying the application of or the exercise of or liability under such term, such term shall be deemed to be included in this Agreement. However, the liability of Supplier for any breach of such term shall be limited, at the option of Supplier, to any one or more of the following: if the breach related to goods: the replacement of the goods or the supply of equivalent goods; the repair of such goods; the payment of the cost of replacing the goods or of acquiring equivalent goods; or the payment of the cost of having the goods repaired; and if the breach relates to services the supplying of the services again; or the payment of the cost of having the services supplied again. \r\n8. TERMINATION. \r\n8.1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. All sublicenses to the Covered Code which are properly granted shall survive any termination of this License. Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License shall survive. \r\n8.2. If You initiate litigation by asserting a patent infringement claim (excluding declatory judgment actions) against Initial Developer or a Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom You file such action is referred to as \"Participant\") alleging that: \r\n(a) such Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted by such Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and\/or 2.2 of this License shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate prospectively, unless if within 60 days after receipt of notice You either: (i) agree in writing to pay Participant a mutually agreeable reasonable royalty for Your past and future use of Modifications made by such Participant, or (ii) withdraw Your litigation claim with respect to the Contributor Version against such Participant. If within 60 days of notice, a reasonable royalty and payment arrangement are not mutually agreed upon in writing by the parties or the litigation claim is not withdrawn, the rights granted by Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and\/or 2.2 automatically terminate at the expiration of the 60 day notice period specified above. \r\n(b) any software, hardware, or device, other than such Participant's Contributor Version, directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any rights granted to You by such Participant under Sections 2.1(b) and 2.2(b) are revoked effective as of the date You first made, used, sold, distributed, or had made, Modifications made by that Participant. \r\n8.3. If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant alleging that such Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as by license or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses granted by such Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken into account in determining the amount or value of any payment or license. \r\n8.4. In the event of termination under Sections 8.1 or 8.2 above, all end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder prior to termination shall survive termination. \r\n9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. \r\nUNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED CODE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. \r\n10. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS. \r\nThe Covered Code is a \"commercial item,\" as that term is defined in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of \"commercial computer software\" and \"commercial computer software documentation,\" as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Code with only those rights set forth herein. \r\n11. MISCELLANEOUS. \r\nThis License represents the complete agreement concerning subject matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable. \r\nThis Agreement shall be governed by and construed according to the law of the State of Victoria. The parties irrevocably submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Courts of Victoria and Australia and any Courts hearing appeals from such Courts. This Agreement is deemed to have been made in Victoria. \r\nThe application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not apply to this License. \r\n12. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS. \r\nAs between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly, out of its utilization of rights under this License and You agree to work with Initial Developer and Contributors to distribute such responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing herein is intended or shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability. \r\n13. MULTIPLE-LICENSED CODE. \r\nInitial Developer may designate portions of the Covered Code as \"Multiple-Licensed\". \"Multiple-Licensed\" means that the Initial Developer permits you to utilize portions of the Covered Code under Your choice of the NPL or the alternative licenses, if any, specified by the Initial Developer in the file described in Exhibit A. \r\nEXHIBIT A - Netizen Open Source License \r\n``The contents of this file are subject to the Netizen Open Source License Version 1.0 (the \"License\"); you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.

ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.\r\n \r\n \r\nDEFINITIONS\r\n \r\n\"Contribution\" means:\r\n \r\nin the case of The Open Group, L.L.C. (\"The Open Group\"), the Original Program, and\r\n \r\nin the case of each Contributor,\r\n                                                              i.       changes to the Program, and\r\n                                                           ii.      additions to the Program;\r\n \r\nwhere such changes and\/or additions to the Program originate from and are distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution 'originates' from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor's behalf. Contributions do not include additions to the Program which:\r\n \r\n                                      i.      are separate modules of software distributed in conjunction with the Program under their own license agreement, even if the separate modules are linked in binary form to the Program, and\r\n                                   ii.      are not derivative works of the Program.\r\n \r\n\"Contributor\" means The Open Group and any other entity that distributes the Program.\r\n \r\n\"Licensed Patents\" mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone or when combined with the Program.\r\n \r\n\"Open Source\" programs mean software for which the source code is available without confidential or trade secret restrictions and for which the source code and object code are available for distribution without license charges.\r\n\"Original Program\" means the original version of the software accompanying this Agreement as released by The Open Group, including source code, object code and documentation, if any.\r\n \r\n\"Program\" means the Original Program and Contributions.\r\n \r\n\"Recipient\" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement, including all Contributors.\r\n \r\n \r\nGRANT OF RIGHTS\r\n \r\nThe rights granted under this license are limited solely to distribution and sublicensing of the Contribution(s) on, with, or for operating systems which are themselves Open Source programs. Contact The Open Group for a license allowing distribution and sublicensing of the Original Program on, with, or for operating systems which are not Open Source programs.\r\n \r\nSubject to the terms of this Agreement and the limitations of this Section 2, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, and such derivative works, in source code and object code form.\r\n \r\n Subject to the terms of this Agreement and the limitations of this Section 2, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in source code and object code form. This patent license shall apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is licensed hereunder.\r\n \r\nRecipient understands that although each Contributor grants the licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity. Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party patent license is required to allow Recipient to distribute the Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license before distributing the Program.\r\n \r\nEach Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright license set forth in this Agreement.\r\n \r\n \r\nREQUIREMENTS\r\n \r\nA Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form under its own license agreement, provided that:\r\n \r\na.      it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and\r\n \r\nb.     its license agreement:\r\n                                                        i.      effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties and conditions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose;\r\n                                                     ii.      effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits;\r\n                                                   iii.      states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are offered by that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and\r\n                                                   iv.      states that source code for the Program is available from such Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily used for software exchange.\r\n \r\nWhen the Program is made available in source code form:\r\n \r\na.      it must be made available under this Agreement; and\r\n \r\nb.     a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the Program.\r\n \r\nEach Contributor must include the following in a conspicuous location in the Program:\r\n \r\nCopyright (c) {date here}, The Open Group Ltd. and others. All Rights Reserved.\r\n \r\nIn addition, each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its Contribution, if any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent Recipients to identify the originator of the Contribution.\r\n \r\n \r\nCOMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION\r\n \r\nCommercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, subject to the limitations provided in Section 2, the Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner which does not create potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering, such Contributor (\"Commercial Contributor\") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every other Contributor (\"Indemnified Contributor\") against any losses, damages and costs (collectively \"Losses\") arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program in a commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must:\r\n \r\na.      promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in writing of such claim, and\r\n \r\nb.     allow the Commercial Contributor to control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defence and any related settlement negotiations.\r\n \r\nThe Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such claim at its own expense.\r\n \r\nFor example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims against the other Contributors related to those performance claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay those damages.\r\n \r\n \r\nNO WARRANTY\r\n \r\nEXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN \"AS IS\" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement, including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.\r\n \r\n \r\nDISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY\r\n \r\nEXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\r\n \r\n \r\nGENERAL\r\n \r\nIf any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.\r\n \r\nIf Recipient institutes patent litigation or other similar official proceedings to enforce patent rights against a Contributor with respect to a patent applicable to software (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit), then any patent licenses granted by that Contributor to such Recipient under this Agreement shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed. In addition, If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software or hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.\r\n \r\nAll Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after becoming aware of such non-compliance. If all Recipient's rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable. However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement and any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and survive.\r\n \r\nThe Open Group may publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement from time to time. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing version number. The Program (including Contributions) may always be distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which it was received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is published, Contributor may elect to distribute the Program (including its Contributions) under the new version. No one other than The Open Group has the right to modify this Agreement. Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual property of any Contributor under this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved.\r\n \r\nNo party to this Agreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement more than one year after the cause of action arose. Each party waives its rights to a jury trial in any resulting litigation.\r\n ",

Nothing in this License shall be\r\ndeemed to grant any rights to trademarks, copyrights, patents, trade\r\nsecrets or any other intellectual property of Licensor except as\r\nexpressly stated herein.

Nothing in this License shall be interpreted to prohibit\r\nLicensor from licensing under different terms from this License any\r\nOriginal Work that Licensor otherwise would have a right to license.\r\n\r\n5) External Deployment.

HISTORY OF THE SOFTWARE\r\n==========================\r\n\r\nPython was created in the early 1990s by Guido van Rossum at Stichting\r\nMathematisch Centrum (CWI, see http:\/\/www.cwi.nl) in the Netherlands\r\nas a successor of a language called ABC.  Guido remains Python's\r\nprincipal author, although it includes many contributions from others.\r\n\r\nIn 1995, Guido continued his work on Python at the Corporation for\r\nNational Research Initiatives (CNRI, see http:\/\/www.cnri.reston.va.us)\r\nin Reston, Virginia where he released several versions of the\r\nsoftware.\r\n\r\nIn May 2000, Guido and the Python core development team moved to\r\nBeOpen.com to form the BeOpen PythonLabs team.  In October of the same\r\nyear, the PythonLabs team moved to Digital Creations (now Zope\r\nCorporation, see http:\/\/www.zope.com).  In 2001, the Python Software\r\nFoundation (PSF, see http:\/\/www.python.org\/psf\/) was formed, a\r\nnon-profit organization created specifically to own Python-related\r\nIntellectual Property.

All Python licenses, unlike the GPL, let you distribute\r\n    a modified version without making your changes open source.  The\r\n    GPL-compatible licenses make it possible to combine Python with\r\n    other software that is released under the GPL; the others don't.\r\n\r\n(2) According to Richard Stallman, 1.6.1 is not GPL-compatible,\r\n    because its license has a choice of law clause.  According to\r\n    CNRI, however, Stallman's lawyer has told CNRI's lawyer that 1.6.1\r\n    is \"not incompatible\" with the GPL.\r\n\r\nThanks to the many outside volunteers who have worked under Guido's\r\ndirection to make these releases possible.\r\n\r\n\r\nB.

Additional Definitions.\r\n\r\n  As used herein, \"this License\" refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser\r\nGeneral Public License, and the \"GNU GPL\" refers to version 3 of the GNU\r\nGeneral Public License.\r\n\r\n  \"The Library\" refers to a covered work governed by this License,\r\nother than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.\r\n\r\n  An \"Application\" is any work that makes use of an interface provided\r\nby the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library.\r\nDefining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode\r\nof using an interface provided by the Library.\r\n\r\n  A \"Combined Work\" is a work produced by combining or linking an\r\nApplication with the Library.  The particular version of the Library\r\nwith which the Combined Work was made is also called the \"Linked\r\nVersion\".\r\n\r\n  The \"Minimal Corresponding Source\" for a Combined Work means the\r\nCorresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code\r\nfor portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are\r\nbased on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.\r\n\r\n  The \"Corresponding Application Code\" for a Combined Work means the\r\nobject code and\/or source code for the Application, including any data\r\nand utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the\r\nApplication, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.\r\n\r\n  1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.\r\n\r\n  You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License\r\nwithout being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.\r\n\r\n  2. Conveying Modified Versions.\r\n\r\n  If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a\r\nfacility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application\r\nthat uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the\r\nfacility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified\r\nversion:\r\n\r\n   a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to\r\n   ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the\r\n   function or data, the facility still operates, and performs\r\n   whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or\r\n\r\n   b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of\r\n   this License applicable to that copy.\r\n\r\n  3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.\r\n\r\n  The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from\r\na header file that is part of the Library.  You may convey such object\r\ncode under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated\r\nmaterial is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure\r\nlayouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates\r\n(ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:\r\n\r\n   a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the\r\n   Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are\r\n   covered by this License.\r\n\r\n   b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license\r\n   document.\r\n\r\n  4. Combined Works.\r\n\r\n  You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that,\r\ntaken together, effectively do not restrict modification of the\r\nportions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse\r\nengineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of\r\nthe following:\r\n\r\n   a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that\r\n   the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are\r\n   covered by this License.\r\n\r\n   b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license\r\n   document.\r\n\r\n   c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during\r\n   execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among\r\n   these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the\r\n   copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.\r\n\r\n   d) Do one of the following:\r\n\r\n       0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this\r\n       License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form\r\n       suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to\r\n       recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of\r\n       the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the\r\n       manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying\r\n       Corresponding Source.\r\n\r\n       1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the\r\n       Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time\r\n       a copy of the Library already present on the user's computer\r\n       system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version\r\n       of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked\r\n       Version.\r\n\r\n   e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise\r\n   be required to provide such information under section 6 of the\r\n   GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is\r\n   necessary to install and execute a modified version of the\r\n   Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the\r\n   Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If\r\n   you use option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany\r\n   the Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application\r\n   Code. If you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation\r\n   Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL\r\n   for conveying Corresponding Source.)\r\n\r\n  5. Combined Libraries.\r\n\r\n  You may place library facilities that are a work based on the\r\nLibrary side by side in a single library together with other library\r\nfacilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this\r\nLicense, and convey such a combined library under terms of your\r\nchoice, if you do both of the following:\r\n\r\n   a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based\r\n   on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities,\r\n   conveyed under the terms of this License.\r\n\r\n   b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it\r\n   is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the\r\n   accompanying uncombined form of the same work.\r\n\r\n  6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.\r\n\r\n  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and\/or new versions\r\nof the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new\r\nversions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may\r\ndiffer in detail to address new problems or concerns.\r\n\r\n  Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the\r\nLibrary as you received it specifies that a certain numbered version\r\nof the GNU Lesser General Public License \"or any later version\"\r\napplies to it, you have the option of following the terms and\r\nconditions either of that published version or of any later version\r\npublished by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you\r\nreceived it does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser\r\nGeneral Public License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser\r\nGeneral Public License ever published by the Free Software Foundation.\r\n\r\n  If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide\r\nwhether future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall\r\napply, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of any version is\r\npermanent authorization for you to choose that version for the\r\nLibrary.",

To generate your own. change the values of OWNER, ORGANIZATION, and YEAR from their original values as given here, and substitute your own.\r\n\r\n<ORGANIZATION:> = Lucent Technologies Inc.\r\n\r\n<OWNER> = LUCENT\r\n\r\n<YEAR> = 2003\r\n\r\nHere is the license template:\r\n\r\nTHE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS PUBLIC LICENSE (\"AGREEMENT\"). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.\r\n\r\n1. DEFINITIONS\r\n\r\n\"Contribution\" means:\r\n\r\nin the case of <ORGANIZATION:> (\"<OWNER>\"), the Original Program, and\r\nin the case of each Contributor,\r\nchanges to the Program, and\r\nadditions to the Program;\r\nwhere such changes and\/or additions to the Program were added to the Program by such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor's behalf, and the Contributor explicitly consents, in accordance with Section 3C, to characterization of the changes and\/or additions as Contributions.\r\n\r\n\"Contributor\" means <OWNER> and any other entity that has Contributed a Contribution to the Program.\r\n\r\n\"Distributor\" means a Recipient that distributes the Program, modifications to the Program, or any part thereof.\r\n\r\n\"Licensed Patents\" mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone or when combined with the Program.\r\n\r\n\"Original Program\" means the original version of the software accompanying this Agreement as released by <OWNER>, including source code, object code and documentation, if any.\r\n\r\n\"Program\" means the Original Program and Contributions or any part thereof\r\n\r\n\"Recipient\" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement, including all Contributors.\r\n\r\n2. GRANT OF RIGHTS\r\n\r\na. Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, and such derivative works, in source code and object code form.\r\n\r\nb. Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in source code and object code form. The patent license granted by a Contributor shall also apply to the combination of the Contribution of that Contributor and the Program if, at the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the Licensed Patents. The patent license granted by a Contributor shall not apply to (i) any other combinations which include the Contribution, nor to (ii) Contributions of other Contributors. No hardware per se is licensed hereunder.\r\n\r\nc. Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity. Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party patent license is required to allow Recipient to distribute the Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license before distributing the Program.\r\n\r\nd. Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright license set forth in this Agreement.\r\n\r\n3. REQUIREMENTS\r\n\r\nA. Distributor may choose to distribute the Program in any form under this Agreement or under its own license agreement, provided that:\r\n\r\nit complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement;\r\nif the Program is distributed in source code or other tangible form, a copy of this Agreement or Distributor's own license agreement is included with each copy of the Program; and\r\nif distributed under Distributor's own license agreement, such license agreement:\r\neffectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties and conditions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose;\r\neffectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits; and\r\nstates that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are offered by that Contributor alone and not by any other party.\r\nB. Each Distributor must include the following in a conspicuous location in the Program:\r\n\r\nCopyright (C) <YEAR>, <ORGANIZATION> and others. All Rights Reserved.\r\n\r\nC. In addition, each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its Contribution in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent Recipients to identify the originator of the Contribution. Also, each Contributor must agree that the additions and\/or changes are intended to be a Contribution. Once a Contribution is contributed, it may not thereafter be revoked.\r\n\r\n4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION\r\n\r\nCommercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the Distributor who includes the Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner which does not create potential liability for Contributors. Therefore, if a Distributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering, such Distributor (\"Commercial Distributor\") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every Contributor (\"Indemnified Contributor\") against any losses, damages and costs (collectively \"Losses\") arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial Distributor in connection with its distribution of the Program in a commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial Distributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Distributor to control, and cooperate with the Commercial Distributor in, the defense and any related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such claim at its own expense.\r\n\r\nFor example, a Distributor might include the Program in a commercial product offering, Product X. That Distributor is then a Commercial Distributor. If that Commercial Distributor then makes performance claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are such Commercial Distributor's responsibility alone. Under this section, the Commercial Distributor would have to defend claims against the Contributors related to those performance claims and warranties, and if a court requires any Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Distributor must pay those damages.\r\n\r\n5. NO WARRANTY\r\n\r\nEXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN \"AS IS\" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement, including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.\r\n\r\n6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY\r\n\r\nEXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\r\n\r\n7. EXPORT CONTROL\r\n\r\nRecipient agrees that Recipient alone is responsible for compliance with the United States export administration regulations (and the export control laws and regulation of any other countries).\r\n\r\n8. GENERAL\r\n\r\nIf any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.\r\n\r\nIf Recipient institutes patent litigation against a Contributor with respect to a patent applicable to software (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit), then any patent licenses granted by that Contributor to such Recipient under this Agreement shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed. In addition, if Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software or hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.\r\n\r\nAll Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable. However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement and any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and survive.\r\n\r\nLUCENT may publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement from time to time. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing version number. The Program (including Contributions) may always be distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which it was received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is published, Contributor may elect to distribute the Program (including its Contributions) under the new version. No one other than LUCENT has the right to modify this Agreement. Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual property of any Contributor under this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved.\r\n\r\nThis Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and the intellectual property laws of the United States of America. No party to this Agreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement more than one year after the cause of action arose. Each party waives its rights to a jury trial in any resulting litigation.",

Distribution Obligations.\r\n3.1. Application of License. \r\nThe Modifications which You create or to which You contribute are governed by the terms of this License, including without limitation Section 2.2.

However, You may include an additional document offering the additional rights described in Section 3.5.\r\n3.2. Availability of Source Code. \r\nAny Modification which You create or to which You contribute must be made available in Source Code form under the terms of this License either on the same media as an Executable version or via an accepted Electronic Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom you made an Executable version available; and if made available via Electronic Distribution Mechanism, must remain available for at least twelve (12) months after the date it initially became available, or at least six (6) months after a subsequent version of that particular Modification has been made available to such recipients. You are responsible for ensuring that the Source Code version remains available even if the Electronic Distribution Mechanism is maintained by a third party.\r\n\r\n3.3. Description of Modifications. \r\nYou must cause all Covered Code to which you contribute to contain a file documenting the changes You made to create that Covered Code and the date of any change. You must include a prominent statement that the Modification is derived, directly or indirectly, from Original Code provided by the Initial Developer and including the name of the Initial Developer in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in any notice in an Executable version or related documentation in which You describe the origin or ownership of the Covered Code.\r\n\r\n3.4. Intellectual Property Matters\r\n\r\n(a) Third Party Claims. \r\nIf You have knowledge that a party claims an intellectual property right in particular functionality or code (or its utilization under this License), you must include a text file with the source code distribution titled ``LEGAL'' which describes the claim and the party making the claim in sufficient detail that a recipient will know whom to contact. If you obtain such knowledge after You make Your Modification available as described in Section 3.2, You shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies You make available thereafter and shall take other steps (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably calculated to inform those who received the Covered Code that new knowledge has been obtained.\r\n\r\n(b) Contributor APIs. \r\nIf Your Modification is an application programming interface and You own or control patents which are reasonably necessary to implement that API, you must also include this information in the LEGAL file.\r\n\r\n3.5. Required Notices. \r\nYou must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source Code, and this License in any documentation for the Source Code, where You describe recipients' rights relating to Covered Code. If You created one or more Modification(s), You may add your name as a Contributor to the notice described in Exhibit A. If it is not possible to put such notice in a particular Source Code file due to its structure, then you must include such notice in a location (such as a relevant directory file) where a user would be likely to look for such a notice. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Code. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear than any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.\r\n\r\n3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions. \r\nYou may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the requirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered Code, and if You include a notice stating that the Source Code version of the Covered Code is available under the terms of this License, including a description of how and where You have fulfilled the obligations of Section 3.2. The notice must be conspicuously included in any notice in an Executable version, related documentation or collateral in which You describe recipients' rights relating to the Covered Code. You may distribute the Executable version of Covered Code under a license of Your choice, which may contain terms different from this License, provided that You are in compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the Executable version does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient's rights in the Source Code version from the rights set forth in this License. If You distribute the Executable version under a different license You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ from this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such terms You offer.\r\n\r\n3.7. Larger Works. \r\nYou may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other code not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code.\r\n\r\n4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.\r\nIf it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License with respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to statute or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must be included in the LEGAL file described in Section 3.4 and must be included with all distributions of the Source Code. Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.\r\n\r\n5. Application of this License.\r\nThis License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has attached the notice in Exhibit A, and to related Covered Code.\r\n6. Versions of the License.\r\n6.1. New Versions. \r\nNetscape Communications Corporation (``Netscape'') may publish revised and\/or new versions of the License from time to time. Each version will be given a distinguishing version number.\r\n6.2. Effect of New Versions. \r\nOnce Covered Code has been published under a particular version of the License, You may always continue to use it under the terms of that version. You may also choose to use such Covered Code under the terms of any subsequent version of the License published by Netscape. No one other than Netscape has the right to modify the terms applicable to Covered Code created under this License.\r\n\r\n6.3. Derivative Works. \r\nIf you create or use a modified version of this License (which you may only do in order to apply it to code which is not already Covered Code governed by this License), you must (a) rename Your license so that the phrases ``Mozilla'', ``MOZILLAPL'', ``MOZPL'', ``Netscape'', ``NPL'' or any confusingly similar phrase do not appear anywhere in your license and (b) otherwise make it clear that your version of the license contains terms which differ from the Mozilla Public License and Netscape Public License. (Filling in the name of the Initial Developer, Original Code or Contributor in the notice described in Exhibit A shall not of themselves be deemed to be modifications of this License.)\r\n\r\n7. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.\r\nCOVERED CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN ``AS IS'' BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED CODE IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED CODE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED CODE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED CODE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.\r\n8. TERMINATION.\r\nThis License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. All sublicenses to the Covered Code which are properly granted shall survive any termination of this License. Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License shall survive.\r\n9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.\r\nUNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED CODE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO YOU OR ANY OTHER PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THAT EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\r\n10. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.\r\nThe Covered Code is a ``commercial item,'' as that term is defined in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of ``commercial computer software'' and ``commercial computer software documentation,'' as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Code with only those rights set forth herein.\r\n11. MISCELLANEOUS.\r\nThis License represents the complete agreement concerning subject matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be governed by California law provisions (except to the extent applicable law, if any, provides otherwise), excluding its conflict-of-law provisions. With respect to disputes in which at least one party is a citizen of, or an entity chartered or registered to do business in, the United States of America: (a) unless otherwise agreed in writing, all disputes relating to this License (excepting any dispute relating to intellectual property rights) shall be subject to final and binding arbitration, with the losing party paying all costs of arbitration; (b) any arbitration relating to this Agreement shall be held in Santa Clara County, California, under the auspices of JAMS\/EndDispute; and (c) any litigation relating to this Agreement shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Courts of the Northern District of California, with venue lying in Santa Clara County, California, with the losing party responsible for costs, including without limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys fees and expenses. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not apply to this License.\r\n12. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.\r\nExcept in cases where another Contributor has failed to comply with Section 3.4, You are responsible for damages arising, directly or indirectly, out of Your utilization of rights under this License, based on the number of copies of Covered Code you made available, the revenues you received from utilizing such rights, and other relevant factors. You agree to work with affected parties to distribute responsibility on an equitable basis.\r\nAMENDMENTS\r\nAdditional Terms applicable to the Netscape Public License.\r\nI. Effect. \r\nThese additional terms described in this Netscape Public License -- Amendments shall apply to the Mozilla Communicator client code and to all Covered Code under this License.\r\n\r\nII. ``Netscape's Branded Code'' means Covered Code that Netscape distributes and\/or permits others to distribute under one or more trademark(s) which are controlled by Netscape but which are not licensed for use under this License.\r\n\r\nIII. Netscape and logo. \r\nThis License does not grant any rights to use the trademark ``Netscape'', the ``Netscape N and horizon'' logo or the Netscape lighthouse logo, even if such marks are included in the Original Code.\r\n\r\nIV. Inability to Comply Due to Contractual Obligation. \r\nPrior to licensing the Original Code under this License, Netscape has licensed third party code for use in Netscape's Branded Code. To the extent that Netscape is limited contractually from making such third party code available under this License, Netscape may choose to reintegrate such code into Covered Code without being required to distribute such code in Source Code form, even if such code would otherwise be considered ``Modifications'' under this License.\r\n\r\nV. Use of Modifications and Covered Code by Initial Developer.\r\n\r\nV.1. In General. \r\nThe obligations of Section 3 apply to Netscape, except to the extent specified in this Amendment, Section V.2 and V.3.\r\n\r\nV.2. Other Products. \r\nNetscape may include Covered Code in products other than the Netscape's Branded Code which are released by Netscape during the two (2) years following the release date of the Original Code, without such additional products becoming subject to the terms of this License, and may license such additional products on different terms from those contained in this License.\r\n\r\nV.3. Alternative Licensing. \r\nNetscape may license the Source Code of Netscape's Branded Code, including Modifications incorporated therein, without such additional products becoming subject to the terms of this License, and may license such additional products on different terms from those contained in this License.\r\n\r\nVI. Arbitration and Litigation. \r\nNotwithstanding the limitations of Section 11 above, the provisions regarding arbitration and litigation in Section 11(a), (b) and (c) of the License shall apply to all disputes relating to this License.\r\n\r\nEXHIBIT A.\r\n``The contents of this file are subject to the Netscape Public License Version 1.0 (the \"License\"); you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.

Licensor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual, sublicenseable license to do the following:\r\n\r\na) to reproduce the Original Work in copies;\r\nb) to prepare derivative works (\"Derivative Works\") based upon the Original Work;\r\n\r\nc) to distribute copies of the Original Work and Derivative Works to the public, with the proviso that copies of Original Work or Derivative Works that You distribute shall be licensed under the Open Software License;\r\n\r\nd) to perform the Original Work publicly; and\r\n\r\ne) to display the Original Work publicly.\r\n\r\n2) Grant of Patent License. Licensor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual, sublicenseable license, under patent claims owned or controlled by the Licensor that are embodied in the Original Work as furnished by the Licensor, to make, use, sell and offer for sale the Original Work and Derivative Works.\r\n\r\n3) Grant of Source Code License. The term \"Source Code\" means the preferred form of the Original Work for making modifications to it and all available documentation describing how to modify the Original Work. Licensor hereby agrees to provide a machine-readable copy of the Source Code of the Original Work along with each copy of the Original Work that Licensor distributes. Licensor reserves the right to satisfy this obligation by placing a machine-readable copy of the Source Code in an information repository reasonably calculated to permit inexpensive and convenient access by You for as long as Licensor continues to distribute the Original Work, and by publishing the address of that information repository in a notice immediately following the copyright notice that applies to the Original Work.\r\n\r\n4) Exclusions From License Grant. Neither the names of Licensor, nor the names of any contributors to the Original Work, nor any of their trademarks or service marks, may be used to endorse or promote products derived from this Original Work without express prior written permission of the Licensor. Nothing in this License shall be deemed to grant any rights to trademarks, copyrights, patents, trade secrets or any other intellectual property of Licensor except as expressly stated herein. No patent license is granted to make, use, sell or offer to sell embodiments of any patent claims other than the licensed claims defined in Section 2. No right is granted to the trademarks of Licensor even if such marks are included in the Original Work. Nothing in this License shall be interpreted to prohibit Licensor from licensing under different terms from this License any Original Work that Licensor otherwise would have a right to license.\r\n\r\n5) External Deployment. The term \"External Deployment\" means the use or distribution of the Original Work or Derivative Works in any way such that the Original Work or Derivative Works may be used by anyone other than You, whether the Original Work or Derivative Works are distributed to those persons or made available as an application intended for use over a computer network. As an express condition for the grants of license hereunder, You agree that any External Deployment by You of a Derivative Work shall be deemed a distribution and shall be licensed to all under the terms of this License, as prescribed in section 1(c) herein.\r\n\r\n6) Attribution Rights. You must retain, in the Source Code of any Derivative Works that You create, all copyright, patent or trademark notices from the Source Code of the Original Work, as well as any notices of licensing and any descriptive text identified therein as an \"Attribution Notice.\" You must cause the Source Code for any Derivative Works that You create to carry a prominent Attribution Notice reasonably calculated to inform recipients that You have modified the Original Work.\r\n\r\n7) Warranty of Provenance and Disclaimer of Warranty.

If You distribute copies of the Original Work or a Derivative Work, You must make a reasonable effort under the circumstances to obtain the express assent of recipients to the terms of this License. Nothing else but this License (or another written agreement between Licensor and You) grants You permission to create Derivative Works based upon the Original Work or to exercise any of the rights granted in Section 1 herein, and any attempt to do so except under the terms of this License (or another written agreement between Licensor and You) is expressly prohibited by U.S. copyright law, the equivalent laws of other countries, and by international treaty. Therefore, by exercising any of the rights granted to You in Section 1 herein, You indicate Your acceptance of this License and all of its terms and conditions. This License shall terminate immediately and you may no longer exercise any of the rights granted to You by this License upon Your failure to honor the proviso in Section 1(c) herein.\r\n\r\n10) Termination for Patent Action. This License shall terminate automatically and You may no longer exercise any of the rights granted to You by this License as of the date You commence an action, including a cross-claim or counterclaim, for patent infringement (i) against Licensor with respect to a patent applicable to software or (ii) against any entity with respect to a patent applicable to the Original Work (but excluding combinations of the Original Work with other software or hardware).\r\n\r\n11) Jurisdiction, Venue and Governing Law. Any action or suit relating to this License may be brought only in the courts of a jurisdiction wherein the Licensor resides or in which Licensor conducts its primary business, and under the laws of that jurisdiction excluding its conflict-of-law provisions. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any use of the Original Work outside the scope of this License or after its termination shall be subject to the requirements and penalties of the U.S. Copyright Act, 17 U.S.C. 101 et seq., the equivalent laws of other countries, and international treaty.

In any action to enforce the terms of this License or seeking damages relating thereto, the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover its costs and expenses, including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees and costs incurred in connection with such action, including any appeal of such action. This section shall survive the termination of this License.\r\n\r\n13) Miscellaneous. This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable.\r\n\r\n14) Definition of \"You\" in This License. \"You\" throughout this License, whether in upper or lower case, means an individual or a legal entity exercising rights under, and complying with all of the terms of, this License. For legal entities, \"You\" includes any entity that controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with you.

HISTORY OF THE SOFTWARE\r\n==========================\r\n\r\nPython was created in the early 1990s by Guido van Rossum at Stichting\r\nMathematisch Centrum (CWI, see http:\/\/www.cwi.nl) in the Netherlands\r\nas a successor of a language called ABC.  Guido remains Python's\r\nprincipal author, although it includes many contributions from others.\r\n\r\nIn 1995, Guido continued his work on Python at the Corporation for\r\nNational Research Initiatives (CNRI, see http:\/\/www.cnri.reston.va.us)\r\nin Reston, Virginia where he released several versions of the\r\nsoftware.\r\n\r\nIn May 2000, Guido and the Python core development team moved to\r\nBeOpen.com to form the BeOpen PythonLabs team.  In October of the same\r\nyear, the PythonLabs team moved to Digital Creations (now Zope\r\nCorporation, see http:\/\/www.zope.com).  In 2001, the Python Software\r\nFoundation (PSF, see http:\/\/www.python.org\/psf\/) was formed, a\r\nnon-profit organization created specifically to own Python-related\r\nIntellectual Property.  Zope Corporation is a sponsoring member of\r\nthe PSF.\r\n\r\nAll Python releases are Open Source (see http:\/\/www.opensource.org for\r\nthe Open Source Definition).  Historically, most, but not all, Python\r\nreleases have also been GPL-compatible; the table below summarizes\r\nthe various releases.\r\n\r\n    Release         Derived     Year        Owner       GPL-\r\n                    from                                compatible?

All Python licenses, unlike the GPL, let you distribute\r\n    a modified version without making your changes open source.  The\r\n    GPL-compatible licenses make it possible to combine Python with\r\n    other software that is released under the GPL; the others don't.\r\n\r\n(2) According to Richard Stallman, 1.6.1 is not GPL-compatible,\r\n    because its license has a choice of law clause.  According to\r\n    CNRI, however, Stallman's lawyer has told CNRI's lawyer that 1.6.1\r\n    is \"not incompatible\" with the GPL.\r\n\r\nThanks to the many outside volunteers who have worked under Guido's\r\ndirection to make these releases possible.\r\n\r\n\r\nB.

Contributor Grant.\r\n\r\nSubject to third party intellectual property claims, each Contributor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive license\r\n\r\n(a) under intellectual property rights (other than patent or trademark) Licensable by Contributor, to use, reproduce, modify, display, perform, sublicense and distribute the Modifications created by such Contributor (or portions thereof) either on an unmodified basis, with other Modifications, as Covered Code and\/or as part of a Larger Work; and\r\n\r\n(b) under Patent Claims infringed by the making, using, or selling of Modifications made by that Contributor either alone and\/or in combination with its Contributor Version (or portions of such combination), to make, use, sell, offer for sale, have made, and\/or otherwise dispose of: 1) Modifications made by that Contributor (or portions thereof); and 2) the combination of Modifications made by that Contributor with its Contributor Version (or portions of such combination).\r\n\r\n(c) the licenses granted in Sections 2.2(a) and 2.2(b) are effective on the date Contributor first makes Commercial Use of the Covered Code.\r\n\r\n(d) Notwithstanding Section 2.2(b) above, no patent license is granted: 1) for any code that Contributor has deleted from the Contributor Version; 2) separate from the Contributor Version; 3) for infringements caused by: i) third party modifications of Contributor Version or ii) the combination of Modifications made by that Contributor with other software (except as part of the Contributor Version) or other devices; or 4) under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Code in the absence of Modifications made by that Contributor.\r\n\r\n3. Distribution Obligations.\r\n\r\n3.1. Application of License.\r\n\r\nThe Modifications which You create or to which You contribute are governed by the terms of this License, including without limitation Section 2.2. The Source Code version of Covered Code may be distributed only under the terms of this License or a future version of this License released under Section 6.1, and You must include a copy of this License with every copy of the Source Code You distribute. You may not offer or impose any terms on any Source Code version that alters or restricts the applicable version of this License or the recipients' rights hereunder. However, You may include an additional document offering the additional rights described in Section 3.5.\r\n\r\n3.2. Availability of Source Code.\r\n\r\nAny Modification which You create or to which You contribute must be made available in Source Code form under the terms of this License either on the same media as an Executable version or via an accepted Electronic Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom you made an Executable version available; and if made available via Electronic Distribution Mechanism, must remain available for at least twelve (12) months after the date it initially became available, or at least six (6) months after a subsequent version of that particular Modification has been made available to such recipients. You are responsible for ensuring that the Source Code version remains available even if the Electronic Distribution Mechanism is maintained by a third party.\r\n\r\n3.3. Description of Modifications.\r\n\r\nYou must cause all Covered Code to which You contribute to contain a file documenting the changes You made to create that Covered Code and the date of any change. You must include a prominent statement that the Modification is derived, directly or indirectly, from Original Code provided by the Initial Developer and including the name of the Initial Developer in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in any notice in an Executable version or related documentation in which You describe the origin or ownership of the Covered Code.\r\n\r\n3.4. Intellectual Property Matters\r\n\r\n(a) Third Party Claims.\r\n\r\nIf Contributor has knowledge that a license under a third party's intellectual property rights is required to exercise the rights granted by such Contributor under Sections 2.1 or 2.2, Contributor must include a text file with the Source Code distribution titled \"LEGAL'' which describes the claim and the party making the claim in sufficient detail that a recipient will know whom to contact. If Contributor obtains such knowledge after the Modification is made available as described in Section 3.2, Contributor shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies Contributor makes available thereafter and shall take other steps (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably calculated to inform those who received the Covered Code that new knowledge has been obtained.\r\n\r\n(b) Contributor APIs.\r\n\r\nIf Contributor's Modifications include an application programming interface and Contributor has knowledge of patent licenses which are reasonably necessary to implement that API, Contributor must also include this information in the LEGAL file.\r\n\r\n(c) Representations.\r\n\r\nContributor represents that, except as disclosed pursuant to Section 3.4(a) above, Contributor believes that Contributor's Modifications are Contributor's original creation(s) and\/or Contributor has sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by this License.\r\n\r\n3.5. Required Notices.\r\n\r\nYou must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source Code. If it is not possible to put such notice in a particular Source Code file due to its structure, then You must include such notice in a location (such as a relevant directory) where a user would be likely to look for such a notice. If You created one or more Modification(s) You may add your name as a Contributor to the notice described in Exhibit A. You must also duplicate this License in any documentation for the Source Code where You describe recipients' rights or ownership rights relating to Covered Code. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Code. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear than any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.\r\n\r\n3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions.\r\n\r\nYou may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the requirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered Code, and if You include a notice stating that the Source Code version of the Covered Code is available under the terms of this License, including a description of how and where You have fulfilled the obligations of Section 3.2. The notice must be conspicuously included in any notice in an Executable version, related documentation or collateral in which You describe recipients' rights relating to the Covered Code. You may distribute the Executable version of Covered Code or ownership rights under a license of Your choice, which may contain terms different from this License, provided that You are in compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the Executable version does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient's rights in the Source Code version from the rights set forth in this License. If You distribute the Executable version under a different license You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ from this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such terms You offer.\r\n\r\n3.7. Larger Works.\r\n\r\nYou may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other code not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code.\r\n\r\n4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.\r\n\r\nIf it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License with respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must be included in the LEGAL file described in Section 3.4 and must be included with all distributions of the Source Code. Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.\r\n\r\n5. Application of this License.\r\n\r\nThis License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has attached the notice in Exhibit A and to related Covered Code.\r\n\r\n6. Versions of the License.\r\n\r\n6.1. New Versions.\r\n\r\nBorland Software Corporation (''Interbase'') may publish revised and\/or new versions of the License from time to time. Each version will be given a distinguishing version number.\r\n\r\n6.2. Effect of New Versions.\r\n\r\nOnce Covered Code has been published under a particular version of the License, You may always continue to use it under the terms of that version. You may also choose to use such Covered Code under the terms of any subsequent version of the License published by Interbase. No one other than Interbase has the right to modify the terms applicable to Covered Code created under this License.\r\n\r\n6.3. Derivative Works.\r\n\r\nIf You create or use a modified version of this License (which you may only do in order to apply it to code which is not already Covered Code governed by this License), You must (a) rename Your license so that the phrases ''Mozilla'', ''MOZILLAPL'', ''MOZPL'', ''Netscape'', \"MPL\", ''NPL\", \"Interbase\", \"ISC\", \"IB'' or any confusingly similar phrase do not appear in your license (except to note that your license differs from this License) and (b) otherwise make it clear that Your version of the license contains terms which differ from the Mozilla Public License and Netscape Public License. (Filling in the name of the Initial Developer, Original Code or Contributor in the notice described in Exhibit A shall not of themselves be deemed to be modifications of this License.)\r\n\r\n6.4 Origin of the Interbase Public License.\r\n\r\nThe Interbase public license is based on the Mozilla Public License V 1.1 with the following changes:\r\n\r\nThe license is published by Borland Software Corporation. Only Borland Software Corporation can modify the terms applicable to Covered Code.\r\nThe license can be modified used for code which is not already governed by this license. Modified versions of the license must be renamed to avoid confusion with Netscape?s or Interbase Software?s license and must include a description of changes from the Interbase Public License.\r\nThe name of the license in Exhibit A is the \"Interbase Public License\".\r\nThe reference to an alternative license in Exhibit A has been removed.\r\nAmendments I, II, III, V, and VI have been deleted.\r\nExhibit A, Netscape Public License has been deleted\r\nA new amendment (II) has been added, describing the required and restricted rights to use the trademarks of Borland Software Corporation\r\n7. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.\r\n\r\nCOVERED CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN \"AS IS'' BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED CODE IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED CODE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED CODE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED CODE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.\r\n\r\n8. TERMINATION.\r\n\r\n8.1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. All sublicenses to the Covered Code which are properly granted shall survive any termination of this License. Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License shall survive.\r\n\r\n8.2. If You initiate litigation by asserting a patent infringement claim (excluding declatory judgment actions) against Initial Developer or a Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom You file such action is referred to as \"Participant\") alleging that:\r\n\r\n(a) such Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted by such Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and\/or 2.2 of this License shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate prospectively, unless if within 60 days after receipt of notice You either: (i) agree in writing to pay Participant a mutually agreeable reasonable royalty for Your past and future use of Modifications made by such Participant, or (ii) withdraw Your litigation claim with respect to the Contributor Version against such Participant. If within 60 days of notice, a reasonable royalty and payment arrangement are not mutually agreed upon in writing by the parties or the litigation claim is not withdrawn, the rights granted by Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and\/or 2.2 automatically terminate at the expiration of the 60 day notice period specified above.\r\n\r\n(b) any software, hardware, or device, other than such Participant's Contributor Version, directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any rights granted to You by such Participant under Sections 2.1(b) and 2.2(b) are revoked effective as of the date You first made, used, sold, distributed, or had made, Modifications made by that Participant.\r\n\r\n8.3. If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant alleging that such Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as by license or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses granted by such Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken into account in determining the amount or value of any payment or license.\r\n\r\n8.4. In the event of termination under Sections 8.1 or 8.2 above, all end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder prior to termination shall survive termination.\r\n\r\n9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.\r\n\r\nUNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED CODE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\r\n\r\n10. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.\r\n\r\nThe Covered Code is a ''commercial item,'' as that term is defined in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of ''commercial computer software'' and ''commercial computer software documentation,'' as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Code with only those rights set forth herein.\r\n\r\n11. MISCELLANEOUS.\r\n\r\nThis License represents the complete agreement concerning subject matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be governed by California law provisions (except to the extent applicable law, if any, provides otherwise), excluding its conflict-of-law provisions. With respect to disputes in which at least one party is a citizen of, or an entity chartered or registered to do business in the United States of America, any litigation relating to this License shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Courts of the Northern District of California, with venue lying in Santa Clara County, California, with the losing party responsible for costs, including without limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not apply to this License.\r\n\r\n12. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.\r\n\r\nAs between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly, out of its utilization of rights under this License and You agree to work with Initial Developer and Contributors to distribute such responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing herein is intended or shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability.\r\n\r\n13. MULTIPLE-LICENSED CODE.\r\n\r\nInitial Developer may designate portions of the Covered Code as \"Multiple-Licensed\". \"Multiple-Licensed\" means that the Initial Developer permits you to utilize portions of the Covered Code under Your choice of the NPL or the alternative licenses, if any, specified by the Initial Developer in the file described in Exhibit A.\r\n\r\nEXHIBIT A - InterBase Public License.\r\n\r\n``The contents of this file are subject to the Interbase Public License Version 1.0 (the \"License\"); you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.

This license may be particularly suitable if your\r\nprogram is TeX-related (such as a LaTeX package), but you may use it\r\neven if your program is unrelated to TeX.  The section `WHETHER AND HOW\r\nTO DISTRIBUTE PROGRAMS UNDER THIS LICENSE', below, gives instructions,\r\nexamples, and recommendations for authors who are considering\r\ndistributing their programs under this license.\r\n\r\nIn this license document, `The Program' refers to any program\r\ndistributed under this license.\r\n\r\nThis license gives conditions under which The Program may be distributed\r\nand conditions under which modified versions of The Program may be\r\ndistributed.  Individual files of The Program may bear supplementary\r\nand\/or superseding conditions on modification of themselves and on the\r\ndistribution of modified versions of themselves, but *no* file of The\r\nProgram may bear supplementary or superseding conditions on the\r\ndistribution of an unmodified copy of the file.  A distributor wishing\r\nto distribute a complete, unmodified copy of The Program therefore\r\nneeds to check the conditions only in this license and nowhere else.\r\n\r\nActivities other than distribution and\/or modification of The Program\r\nare not covered by this license; they are outside its scope.  In\r\nparticular, the act of running The Program is not restricted.\r\n\r\nWe, the LaTeX3 Project, believe that the conditions below give you\r\nthe freedom to make and distribute modified versions of The Program\r\nthat conform with whatever technical specifications you wish while\r\nmaintaining the availability, integrity, and reliability of\r\nThe Program.  If you do not see how to achieve your goal while \r\nmeeting these conditions, then read the document `cfgguide.tex'\r\nin the base LaTeX distribution for suggestions.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONDITIONS ON DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\r\n===========================================\r\n\r\nYou may distribute a complete, unmodified copy of The Program.\r\nDistribution of only part of The Program is not allowed.\r\n\r\nYou may not modify in any way a file of The Program that bears a legal\r\nnotice forbidding modification of that file.\r\n\r\nYou may distribute a modified file of The Program if, and only if, the\r\nfollowing eight conditions are met:\r\n\r\n  1. You must meet any additional conditions borne by the file on the\r\n     distribution of a modified version of the file as described below\r\n     in the subsection `Additional Conditions on Individual Files of\r\n     The Program'.\r\n \r\n  2. If the file is a LaTeX software file, then you must meet any\r\n     applicable additional conditions on the distribution of a modified\r\n     version of the file that are described below in the subsection\r\n     `Additional Conditions on LaTeX Software Files'.\r\n \r\n  3. You must not distribute the modified file with the filename of the\r\n     original file.\r\n \r\n  4. In the modified file, you must acknowledge the authorship and\r\n     name of the original file, and the name (if any) of the program\r\n     which contains it.\r\n \r\n  5. You must change any identification string in the file to indicate\r\n     clearly that the modified file is not part of The Program.\r\n \r\n  6. You must change any addresses in the modified file for the\r\n     reporting of errors in the file or in The Program generally to\r\n     ensure that reports for files no longer maintained by the original\r\n     maintainers will be directed to the maintainers of the modified\r\n     files.\r\n \r\n  7. You must distribute the modified file under a license that forbids\r\n     distribution both of the modified file and of any files derived\r\n     from the modified file with the filename of the original file.\r\n \r\n  8. You must do either (A) or (B):\r\n\r\n       (A) distribute a copy of The Program (that is, a complete,\r\n           unmodified copy of The Program) together with the modified\r\n           file; if your distribution of the modified file is made by\r\n           offering access to copy the modified file from a designated\r\n           place, then offering equivalent access to copy The Program\r\n           from the same place meets this condition, even though third\r\n           parties are not compelled to copy The Program along with the\r\n           modified file;\r\n\r\n       (B) provide to those who receive the modified file information\r\n           that is sufficient for them to obtain a copy of The Program;\r\n           for example, you may provide a Uniform Resource Locator (URL)\r\n           for a site that you expect will provide them with a copy of \r\n           The Program free of charge (either the version from which\r\n           your modification is derived, or perhaps a later version).\r\n\r\nNote that in the above, `distribution' of a file means making the\r\nfile available to others by any means.  This includes, for instance,\r\ninstalling the file on any machine in such a way that the file is\r\naccessible by users other than yourself.  `Modification' of a file\r\nmeans any procedure that produces a derivative file under any\r\napplicable law -- that is, a file containing the original file or\r\na significant portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications\r\nand\/or translated into another language.\r\n\r\nChanging the name of a file is considered to be a modification of\r\nthe file.\r\n\r\nThe distribution conditions in this license do not have to be\r\napplied to files that have been modified in accordance with the\r\nabove conditions.  Note, however, that Condition 7. does apply to\r\nany such modified file.\r\n\r\nThe conditions above are not intended to prohibit, and hence do not\r\napply to, the updating, by any method, of a file so that it becomes\r\nidentical to the latest version of that file of The Program.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nA Recommendation on Modification Without Distribution\r\n-----------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nIt is wise never to modify a file of The Program, even for your own\r\npersonal use, without also meeting the above eight conditions for\r\ndistributing the modified file.  While you might intend that such\r\nmodified files will never be distributed, often this will happen by\r\naccident -- you may forget that you have modified the file; or it may\r\nnot occur to you when allowing others to access the modified file\r\nthat you are thus distributing it and violating the conditions of\r\nthis license.  It is usually in your best interest to keep your copy\r\nof The Program identical with the public one.  Many programs provide\r\nways to control the behavior of that program without altering its\r\nlicensed files.\r\n\r\n\r\nAdditional Conditions on Individual Files of The Program\r\n--------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nAn individual file of The Program may bear additional conditions that\r\nsupplement and\/or supersede the conditions in this license if, and only\r\nif, such additional conditions exclusively concern modification of the\r\nfile or distribution of a modified version of the file.  The conditions\r\non individual files of The Program therefore may differ only with\r\nrespect to the kind and extent of modification of those files that\r\nis allowed, and with respect to the distribution of modified versions\r\nof those files.\r\n\r\n\r\nAdditional Conditions on LaTeX Software Files\r\n---------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nIf a file of The Program is intended to be used with LaTeX (that is,\r\nif it is a LaTeX software file), then the following additional\r\nconditions, which supplement and\/or supersede the conditions\r\nabove, apply to the file according to its filename extension:\r\n\r\n  - You may not modify any file with filename extension `.ins' since\r\n    these are installation files containing the legal notices that are\r\n    placed in the files they generate.\r\n \r\n  - You may distribute modified versions of files with filename\r\n    extension `.fd' (LaTeX font definition files) under the standard\r\n    conditions of the LPPL as described above.  You may also distribute\r\n    such modified LaTeX font definition files with their original names\r\n    provided that:\r\n    (1) the only changes to the original files either enable use of\r\n        available fonts or prevent attempts to access unavailable fonts;\r\n    (2) you also distribute the original, unmodified files (TeX input\r\n        paths can be used to control which set of LaTeX font definition\r\n        files is actually used by TeX).\r\n\r\n  - You may distribute modified versions of files with filename\r\n    extension `.cfg' (configuration files) with their original names.\r\n    The Program may (and usually will) specify the range of commands\r\n    that are allowed in a particular configuration file.\r\n \r\nBecause of portability and exchangeability issues in LaTeX software,\r\nThe LaTeX3 Project deprecates the distribution of modified versions of\r\ncomponents of LaTeX or of generally available contributed code for them,\r\nbut such distribution can meet the conditions of this license.\r\n\r\n\r\nNO WARRANTY\r\n===========\r\n\r\nThere is no warranty for The Program.  Except when otherwise stated in\r\nwriting, The Copyright Holder provides The Program `as is', without\r\nwarranty of any kind, either expressed or implied, including, but not\r\nlimited to, the implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for\r\na particular purpose.  The entire risk as to the quality and performance\r\nof The Program is with you.  Should The Program prove defective, you\r\nassume the cost of all necessary servicing, repair, or correction.\r\n\r\nIn no event unless agreed to in writing will The Copyright Holder, or\r\nany author named in the files of The Program, or any other party who may\r\ndistribute and\/or modify The Program as permitted below, be liable to\r\nyou for damages, including any general, special, incidental or\r\nconsequential damages arising out of any use of The Program or out of\r\ninability to use The Program (including, but not limited to, loss of\r\ndata, data being rendered inaccurate, or losses sustained by anyone as\r\na result of any failure of The Program to operate with any other\r\nprograms), even if The Copyright Holder or said author or said other\r\nparty has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHETHER AND HOW TO DISTRIBUTE PROGRAMS UNDER THIS LICENSE\r\n=========================================================\r\n\r\nThis section contains important instructions, examples, and\r\nrecommendations for authors who are considering distributing their\r\nprograms under this license.  These authors are addressed as `you' in\r\nthis section.\r\n\r\n\r\nChoosing This License or Another License\r\n----------------------------------------\r\n\r\nIf for any part of your program you want or need to use *distribution*\r\nconditions that differ from those in this license, then do not refer to\r\nthis license anywhere in your program but instead distribute your\r\nprogram under a different license.  You may use the text of this license\r\nas a model for your own license, but your license should not refer to\r\nthe LPPL or otherwise give the impression that your program is\r\ndistributed under the LPPL.\r\n\r\nThe document `modguide.tex' in the base LaTeX distribution explains\r\nthe motivation behind the conditions of this license.  It explains,\r\nfor example, why distributing LaTeX under the GNU General Public\r\nLicense (GPL) was considered inappropriate.  Even if your program is\r\nunrelated to LaTeX, the discussion in `modguide.tex' may still be\r\nrelevant, and authors intending to distribute their programs under any\r\nlicense are encouraged to read it.\r\n\r\n\r\nHow to Use This License\r\n-----------------------\r\n\r\nTo use this license, place in each of the files of your program both\r\nan explicit copyright notice including your name and the year and also\r\na statement that the distribution and\/or modification of the file is\r\nconstrained by the conditions in this license.\r\n\r\nHere is an example of such a notice and statement:\r\n\r\n  %% pig.dtx\r\n  %% Copyright 2001 M. Y. Name\r\n  %\r\n  % This program may be distributed and\/or modified under the\r\n  % conditions of the LaTeX Project Public License, either version 1.1\r\n  % of this license or (at your option) any later version.\r\n  % The latest version of this license is in\r\n  %   http:\/\/www.latex-project.org\/lppl.txt\r\n  % and version 1.1 or later is part of all distributions of LaTeX \r\n  % version 1999\/06\/01 or later.\r\n  %\r\n  % This program consists of the files pig.dtx and pig.ins\r\n\r\nGiven such a notice and statement in a file, the conditions given in\r\nthis license document would apply, with `The Program' referring to the\r\ntwo files `pig.dtx' and `pig.ins', and `The Copyright Holder' referring\r\nto the person `M. Y. Name'.\r\n\r\n\r\nImportant Recommendations\r\n-------------------------\r\n\r\n Defining What Constitutes The Program\r\n\r\n   The LPPL requires that distributions of The Program contain all the\r\n   files of The Program.  It is therefore important that you provide a\r\n   way for the licensee to determine which files constitute The Program.\r\n   This could, for example, be achieved by explicitly listing all the\r\n   files of The Program near the copyright notice of each file or by\r\n   using a line like\r\n\r\n    % This program consists of all files listed in manifest.txt.\r\n\r\n   in that place.  In the absence of an unequivocal list it might be\r\n   impossible for the licensee to determine what is considered by you\r\n   to comprise The Program.\r\n\r\n Noting Exceptional Files\r\n  \r\n   If The Program contains any files bearing additional conditions on\r\n   modification, or on distribution of modified versions, of those\r\n   files (other than those listed in `Additional Conditions on LaTeX\r\n   Software Files'), then it is recommended that The Program contain a\r\n   prominent file that defines the exceptional conditions, and either\r\n   lists the exceptional files or defines one or more categories of\r\n   exceptional files.\r\n\r\n   Files containing the text of a license (such as this file) are\r\n   often examples of files bearing more restrictive conditions on\r\n   modification.  LaTeX configuration files (with filename extension\r\n   `.cfg') are examples of files bearing less restrictive conditions\r\n   on the distribution of a modified version of the file.  The\r\n   additional conditions on LaTeX software given above are examples \r\n   of declaring a category of files bearing exceptional additional\r\n   conditions.",

The Source Code can be in a compressed or archival form, provided the appropriate decompression or de-archiving software is widely available for no charge.\r\n\r\n1.12. ``You'' means an individual or a legal entity exercising rights under, and complying with all of the terms of, this License or a future version of this License issued under Section 6.1. For legal entities, ``You'' includes any entity which controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with You. For purposes of this definition, ``control'' means (a) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or otherwise, or (b) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the outstanding shares or beneficial ownership of such entity.\r\n\r\n2. Source Code License.\r\n2.1. The Initial Developer Grant. \r\nThe Initial Developer hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive license, subject to third party intellectual property claims:\r\n(a) to use, reproduce, modify, display, perform, sublicense and distribute the Original Code (or portions thereof) with or without Modifications, or as part of a Larger Work; and\r\n\r\n(b) under patents now or hereafter owned or controlled by Initial Developer, to make, have made, use and sell (``Utilize'') the Original Code (or portions thereof), but solely to the extent that any such patent is reasonably necessary to enable You to Utilize the Original Code (or portions thereof) and not to any greater extent that may be necessary to Utilize further Modifications or combinations.\r\n\r\n2.2. Contributor Grant. \r\nEach Contributor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive license, subject to third party intellectual property claims:\r\n\r\n(a) to use, reproduce, modify, display, perform, sublicense and distribute the Modifications created by such Contributor (or portions thereof) either on an unmodified basis, with other Modifications, as Covered Code or as part of a Larger Work; and\r\n\r\n(b) under patents now or hereafter owned or controlled by Contributor, to Utilize the Contributor Version (or portions thereof), but solely to the extent that any such patent is reasonably necessary to enable You to Utilize the Contributor Version (or portions thereof), and not to any greater extent that may be necessary to Utilize further Modifications or combinations.\r\n\r\n3. Distribution Obligations.\r\n3.1. Application of License. \r\nThe Modifications which You create or to which You contribute are governed by the terms of this License, including without limitation Section 2.2. The Source Code version of Covered Code may be distributed only under the terms of this License or a future version of this License released under Section 6.1, and You must include a copy of this License with every copy of the Source Code You distribute. You may not offer or impose any terms on any Source Code version that alters or restricts the applicable version of this License or the recipients' rights hereunder. However, You may include an additional document offering the additional rights described in Section 3.5.\r\n3.2. Availability of Source Code. \r\nAny Modification which You create or to which You contribute must be made available in Source Code form under the terms of this License either on the same media as an Executable version or via an accepted Electronic Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom you made an Executable version available; and if made available via Electronic Distribution Mechanism, must remain available for at least twelve (12) months after the date it initially became available, or at least six (6) months after a subsequent version of that particular Modification has been made available to such recipients. You are responsible for ensuring that the Source Code version remains available even if the Electronic Distribution Mechanism is maintained by a third party.\r\n\r\n3.3. Description of Modifications. \r\nYou must cause all Covered Code to which you contribute to contain a file documenting the changes You made to create that Covered Code and the date of any change. You must include a prominent statement that the Modification is derived, directly or indirectly, from Original Code provided by the Initial Developer and including the name of the Initial Developer in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in any notice in an Executable version or related documentation in which You describe the origin or ownership of the Covered Code.\r\n\r\n3.4. Intellectual Property Matters\r\n\r\n(a) Third Party Claims. \r\nIf You have knowledge that a party claims an intellectual property right in particular functionality or code (or its utilization under this License), you must include a text file with the source code distribution titled ``LEGAL'' which describes the claim and the party making the claim in sufficient detail that a recipient will know whom to contact. If you obtain such knowledge after You make Your Modification available as described in Section 3.2, You shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies You make available thereafter and shall take other steps (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably calculated to inform those who received the Covered Code that new knowledge has been obtained.\r\n\r\n(b) Contributor APIs. \r\nIf Your Modification is an application programming interface and You own or control patents which are reasonably necessary to implement that API, you must also include this information in the LEGAL file.\r\n\r\n3.5. Required Notices. \r\nYou must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source Code, and this License in any documentation for the Source Code, where You describe recipients' rights relating to Covered Code. If You created one or more Modification(s), You may add your name as a Contributor to the notice described in Exhibit A. If it is not possible to put such notice in a particular Source Code file due to its structure, then you must include such notice in a location (such as a relevant directory file) where a user would be likely to look for such a notice. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Code. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear than any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.\r\n\r\n3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions. \r\nYou may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the requirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered Code, and if You include a notice stating that the Source Code version of the Covered Code is available under the terms of this License, including a description of how and where You have fulfilled the obligations of Section 3.2. The notice must be conspicuously included in any notice in an Executable version, related documentation or collateral in which You describe recipients' rights relating to the Covered Code. You may distribute the Executable version of Covered Code under a license of Your choice, which may contain terms different from this License, provided that You are in compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the Executable version does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient's rights in the Source Code version from the rights set forth in this License. If You distribute the Executable version under a different license You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ from this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such terms You offer.\r\n\r\n3.7. Larger Works. \r\nYou may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other code not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code.\r\n\r\n4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.\r\nIf it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License with respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to statute or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must be included in the LEGAL file described in Section 3.4 and must be included with all distributions of the Source Code. Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.\r\n\r\n5. Application of this License.\r\nThis License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has attached the notice in Exhibit A, and to related Covered Code.\r\n6. Versions of the License.\r\n6.1. New Versions. \r\nNetscape Communications Corporation (``Netscape'') may publish revised and\/or new versions of the License from time to time. Each version will be given a distinguishing version number.\r\n6.2. Effect of New Versions. \r\nOnce Covered Code has been published under a particular version of the License, You may always continue to use it under the terms of that version. You may also choose to use such Covered Code under the terms of any subsequent version of the License published by Netscape. No one other than Netscape has the right to modify the terms applicable to Covered Code created under this License.\r\n\r\n6.3. Derivative Works. \r\nIf you create or use a modified version of this License (which you may only do in order to apply it to code which is not already Covered Code governed by this License), you must (a) rename Your license so that the phrases ``Mozilla'', ``MOZILLAPL'', ``MOZPL'', ``Netscape'', ``NPL'' or any confusingly similar phrase do not appear anywhere in your license and (b) otherwise make it clear that your version of the license contains terms which differ from the Mozilla Public License and Netscape Public License. (Filling in the name of the Initial Developer, Original Code or Contributor in the notice described in Exhibit A shall not of themselves be deemed to be modifications of this License.)\r\n\r\n7. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.\r\nCOVERED CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN ``AS IS'' BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED CODE IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED CODE IS WITH YOU.

THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED CODE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.\r\n8. TERMINATION.\r\nThis License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. All sublicenses to the Covered Code which are properly granted shall survive any termination of this License. Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License shall survive.\r\n9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.\r\nUNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED CODE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO YOU OR ANY OTHER PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THAT EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\r\n10. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.\r\nThe Covered Code is a ``commercial item,'' as that term is defined in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of ``commercial computer software'' and ``commercial computer software documentation,'' as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Code with only those rights set forth herein.\r\n11. MISCELLANEOUS.\r\nThis License represents the complete agreement concerning subject matter hereof.

With respect to disputes in which at least one party is a citizen of, or an entity chartered or registered to do business in, the United States of America: (a) unless otherwise agreed in writing, all disputes relating to this License (excepting any dispute relating to intellectual property rights) shall be subject to final and binding arbitration, with the losing party paying all costs of arbitration; (b) any arbitration relating to this Agreement shall be held in Santa Clara County, California, under the auspices of JAMS\/EndDispute; and (c) any litigation relating to this Agreement shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Courts of the Northern District of California, with venue lying in Santa Clara County, California, with the losing party responsible for costs, including without limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys fees and expenses. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not apply to this License.\r\n12. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.\r\nExcept in cases where another Contributor has failed to comply with Section 3.4, You are responsible for damages arising, directly or indirectly, out of Your utilization of rights under this License, based on the number of copies of Covered Code you made available, the revenues you received from utilizing such rights, and other relevant factors.

Any  or  all\r\nuse of the Initial Software is subject to  compliance  with  the  terms  and\r\nconditions under which the Holder has elected to distribute its work and  no\r\none shall be entitled to  and it shall have sole entitlement to  modify  the\r\nterms and conditions for the distribution of said Initial Software.\r\n\r\nThe Holder undertakes to maintain the distribution of the  Initial  Software\r\nunder the conditions of  the  Agreement,  for  the  duration  set  forth  in\r\narticle 4.2..\r\n\r\n6.2. OVER THE CONTRIBUTIONS\r\n\r\nThe intellectual property rights over the Contributions belong to  the\r\nholder of the economic rights as designated by effective legislation.\r\n\r\n6.3. OVER THE DYNAMIC MODULES\r\n\r\nThe Licensee having  developed  a  Dynamic  Module  is  the  holder  of  the\r\nintellectual property rights over said Dynamic Module and is free to  choose\r\nthe agreement that shall govern its distribution.\r\n\r\n6.4. JOINT PROVISIONS\r\n\r\n6.4.1. The Licensee expressly undertakes:\r\n- not to remove, or modify, in  any  or  all  manner,  the  intellectual\r\n  property notices affixed to the Software;\r\n- to reproduce said notices, in an identical manner, in  the  copies  of\r\n  the Software.\r\n\r\n6.4.2. The Licensee undertakes not to directly or  indirectly  infringe  the\r\nintellectual property rights of the Holder and\/or Contributors and to  take,\r\nwhere applicable, vis-\u00e0-vis its staff,  any  or  all  measures  required  to\r\nensure respect for said intellectual property rights of  the  Holder  and\/or\r\nContributors.\r\n\r\n\r\nArticle 7  - RELATED SERVICES\r\n-----------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n7.1. Under no circumstances shall  the  Agreement  oblige  the  Licensor  to\r\nprovide technical assistance or maintenance services for the Software.\r\n\r\nHowever, the Licensor is entitled to offer  this  type  of  service. The\r\nterms  and  conditions  of  such  technical  assistance,  and\/or   such \r\nmaintenance, shall then be set forth in  a  separate  instrument.  Only  the\r\nLicensor offering said  maintenance  and\/or  technical  assistance  services\r\nshall incur liability therefor.\r\n\r\n7.2. Similarly, any or all Licensor  shall  be  entitled  to  offer  to  its\r\nLicensees, under its own responsibility, a  warranty,  that  shall  only  be\r\nbinding upon itself, for the  redistribution  of  the  Software  and\/or  the\r\nModified Software, under terms and conditions  that  it  shall  decide  upon\r\nitself. Said warranty,  and  the  financial  terms  and  conditions  of  its\r\napplication, shall be subject to a separate instrument executed between  the\r\nLicensor and the Licensee.\r\n\r\n\r\nArticle 8  - LIABILITY\r\n----------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n8.1. Subject to the provisions of Article 8.2, should the Licensor  fail  to\r\nfulfill all or part of its obligations  hereunder,  the  Licensee  shall  be\r\nentitled to claim compensation for the direct loss suffered  as a result of\r\na fault on the part of the Licensor, subject to providing evidence of it. \r\n\r\n8.2. The Licensor's liability is limited to the commitments made under  this\r\nLicensing Agreement and shall not be incurred as a result ,  in  particular:\r\n(i) of loss due the Licensee's total  or  partial  failure  to  fulfill  its\r\nobligations, (ii) direct or consequential loss due to the Software's use  or\r\nperformance that  is  suffered  by  the  Licensee,  when  the  latter  is  a\r\nprofessional  using  said  Software  for  professional  purposes  and  (iii)\r\nconsequential loss due to the Software's use  or  performance.  The  Parties\r\nexpressly agree that any or all pecuniary or business  loss  (i.e.  loss  of\r\ndata, loss  of  profits,  operating  loss,  loss  of  customers  or  orders,\r\nopportunity cost, any disturbance to business  activities)  or  any  or  all\r\nlegal proceedings instituted against the Licensee by a  third  party,  shall\r\nconstitute consequential loss and shall not provide entitlement  to  any  or\r\nall compensation from the Licensor.\r\n\r\n\r\nArticle 9  - WARRANTY\r\n---------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n9.1. The  Licensee  acknowledges  that  the  current  situation  as  regards\r\nscientific and  technical  know-how  at  the  time  when  the  Software  was\r\ndistributed did not enable all possible uses to be tested and verified,  nor\r\nfor the presence of any or all faults to be detected. In this  respect,  the\r\nLicensee's attention has been drawn to the risks  associated  with  loading,\r\nusing, modifying and\/or developing and reproducing  the  Software  that  are\r\nreserved for experienced users.\r\n\r\nThe Licensee shall be responsible for verifying, by any or  all  means,  the\r\nproduct's suitability for its requirements, its due and proper  functioning,\r\nand for ensuring that it  shall  not  cause  damage  to  either  persons  or\r\nproperty.\r\n\r\n9.2. The Licensor hereby represents, in good faith, that it is  entitled  to\r\ngrant all the rights on the  Software (including in  particular  the  rights\r\nset forth in Article 5 hereof over the Software).\r\n\r\n9.3. The Licensee acknowledges that the Software is supplied \"as is\" by  the\r\nLicensor without any or all other express  or  tacit  warranty,  other  than\r\nthat provided for in Article 9.2 and, in  particular,  without  any  or  all\r\nwarranty as to its market  value,  its  secured,  innovative  or  relevant\r\nnature.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, the Licensor does not warrant that the Software is  free  from\r\nany or all error, that it shall  operate  continuously,  that  it  shall  be\r\ncompatible  with   the   Licensee's   own   equipment   and   its   software\r\nconfiguration, nor that it shall meet the Licensee's requirements.\r\n\r\n9.4. The Licensor does not either expressly  or  tacitly  warrant  that  the\r\nSoftware does not  infringe  any  or  all  third  party  intellectual  right\r\nrelating to a patent, software or  to  any  or  all  other  property  right.\r\nMoreover, the Licensor shall not hold the Licensee harmless against  any  or\r\nall proceedings for infringement that may be instituted in  respect  of  the\r\nuse, modification and redistribution of the Software.  Nevertheless,  should\r\nsuch proceedings be instituted against  the  Licensee,  the  Licensor  shall\r\nprovide it with  technical  and  legal  assistance  for  its  defense.  Such\r\ntechnical and legal assistance shall  be  decided  upon  on  a  case-by-case\r\nbasis  between  the  relevant  Licensor  and  the  Licensee  pursuant  to  a\r\nmemorandum of understanding. The Licensor disclaims any or all liability  as\r\nregards the Licensee's use of the Software's  name.  No  warranty  shall  be\r\nprovided as regards the existence of prior  rights  over  the  name  of  the\r\nSoftware and as regards the existence of a trademark.\r\n\r\n\r\nArticle 10  - TERMINATION\r\n-------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n10.1. In  the  event  of  a  breach  by  the  Licensee  of  its  obligations\r\nhereunder, the Licensor may automatically terminate  this  Agreement  thirty\r\n(30) days after notice has been  sent  to  the  Licensee  and  has  remained\r\nineffective.\r\n\r\n10.2. The  Licensee  whose  Agreement  is  terminated  shall  no  longer  be\r\nauthorized to use, modify or distribute the Software. However,  any  or  all\r\nlicenses that it may have granted prior to  termination  of  the  Agreement\r\nshall remain valid subject to their having been granted in  compliance  with\r\nthe terms and conditions hereof.\r\n\r\n\r\nArticle 11  - MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS\r\n--------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n11.1. EXCUSABLE EVENTS\r\n\r\nNeither Party shall be liable for any or all delay, or  failure  to  perform\r\nthe Agreement, that may be attributable to an event  of  force  majeure,  an\r\nact of God or an outside cause, such as, notably, defective functioning,  or\r\ninterruptions affecting  the  electricity  or  telecommunications  networks,\r\nblocking of the network following a virus attack, the  intervention  of  the\r\ngovernment authorities, natural disasters, water damage, earthquakes,  fire,\r\nexplosions, strikes and labor unrest, war, etc.\r\n\r\n11.2. The fact that either Party may fail, on one or several  occasions,  to\r\ninvoke  one  or  several  of  the  provisions   hereof,   shall   under   no\r\ncircumstances be interpreted as being a waiver by the  interested  Party  of\r\nits entitlement to invoke said provision(s) subsequently.\r\n\r\n11.3. The Agreement cancels and replaces  any  or  all  previous  agreement,\r\nwhether written or oral, between the Parties and having  the  same  purpose,\r\nand  constitutes  the  entirety  of  the  agreement  between  said   Parties\r\nconcerning said purpose. No supplement or  modification  to  the  terms  and\r\nconditions hereof shall be effective as regards the  Parties  unless  it  is\r\nmade in writing and signed by their duly authorized representatives.\r\n\r\n11.4. In the event that one or several of  the  provisions  hereof  were  to\r\nconflict with a current or future applicable act or legislative  text,  said\r\nact or legislative text shall take precedence, and the  Parties  shall  make\r\nthe necessary amendments so  as  to  be  in  compliance  with  said  act  or\r\nlegislative  text.  All  the  other  provisions  shall   remain   effective.\r\nSimilarly, the fact that a provision of  the  Agreement  may   be  null  and\r\nvoid, for any reason whatsoever, shall not cause the Agreement  as  a  whole\r\nto be null and void.\r\n\r\n11.5. LANGUAGE\r\n\r\nThe Agreement is drafted in both French and  English.  In  the  event  of  a\r\nconflict as  regards  construction,  the  French  version  shall  be  deemed\r\nauthentic.\r\n\r\n\r\nArticle 12  - NEW VERSIONS OF THE AGREEMENT\r\n-------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n12.1. Any or all person is authorized to duplicate and distribute copies  of\r\nthis Agreement.\r\n\r\n12.2. So as to ensure coherence, the wording of this Agreement is  protected\r\nand may only be modified by the authors of the  License,  that  reserve  the\r\nright to periodically publish updates or  new  versions  of  the  Agreement,\r\neach with a separate number. These subsequent versions may address new issues\r\nencountered by Free Software.\r\n\r\n12.3. Any  or  all  Software  distributed  under  a  given  version  of  the\r\nAgreement may only be subsequently distributed under  the  same  version  of\r\nthe Agreement, or  a  subsequent  version,  subject  to  the  provisions  of\r\narticle 5.3.4.\r\n\r\n\r\nArticle 13 - GOVERNING LAW AND JURISDICTION\r\n-------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n13.1. The Agreement is  governed  by  French  law.   The  Parties  agree  to\r\nendeavor to settle the disagreements or disputes that may arise  during  the\r\nperformance of the Agreement out-of-court.\r\n\r\n13.2. In the absence of an out-of-court settlement within two (2) months  as\r\nfrom their occurrence, and unless emergency proceedings are  necessary,  the\r\ndisagreements or disputes shall be  referred  to  the  Paris  Courts  having\r\njurisdiction, by the first Party to take action.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                   Version 1.1 of 10\/26\/2004\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Secondarily, this License preserves for the author and publisher a way to get credit for their work, while not being considered responsible for modifications made by others.\r\n\r\nThis License is a kind of \"copyleft\", which means that derivative works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense. It complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft license designed for free software.\r\n\r\nWe have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free software, because free software needs free documentation: a free program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the software does. But this License is not limited to software manuals; it can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or whether it is published as a printed book. We recommend this License principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference.\r\n\r\nAPPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS\r\n\r\nThis License applies to any manual or other work that contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be distributed under the terms of this License. The \"Document\", below, refers to any such manual or work. Any member of the public is a licensee, and is addressed as \"you\".\r\n\r\nA \"Modified Version\" of the Document means any work containing the Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with modifications and\/or translated into another language.\r\n\r\nA \"Secondary Section\" is a named appendix or a front-matter section of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall directly within that overall subject. (For example, if the Document is in part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any mathematics.) The relationship could be a matter of historical connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding them.\r\n\r\nThe \"Invariant Sections\" are certain Secondary Sections whose titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice that says that the Document is released under this License.\r\n\r\nThe \"Cover Texts\" are certain short passages of text that are listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that the Document is released under this License.\r\n\r\nA \"Transparent\" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy, represented in a format whose specification is available to the general public, whose contents can be viewed and edited directly and straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input to text formatters. A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file format whose markup has been designed to thwart or discourage subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent. A copy that is not \"Transparent\" is called \"Opaque\".\r\n\r\nExamples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple HTML designed for human modification. Opaque formats include PostScript, PDF, proprietary formats that can be read and edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD and\/or processing tools are not generally available, and the machine-generated HTML produced by some word processors for output purposes only.\r\n\r\nThe \"Title Page\" means, for a printed book, the title page itself, plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material this License requires to appear in the title page. For works in formats which do not have any title page as such, \"Title Page\" means the text near the most prominent appearance of the work's title, preceding the beginning of the body of the text.\r\n\r\nVERBATIM COPYING\r\n\r\nYou may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other conditions whatsoever to those of this License. You may not use technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further copying of the copies you make or distribute. However, you may accept compensation in exchange for copies. If you distribute a large enough number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.\r\n\r\nYou may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and you may publicly display copies.\r\n\r\nCOPYING IN QUANTITY\r\n\r\nIf you publish printed copies of the Document numbering more than 100, and the Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on the back cover. Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies. The front cover must present the full title with all words of the title equally prominent and visible. You may add other material on the covers in addition. Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in other respects.\r\n\r\nIf the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent pages.\r\n\r\nIf you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy a publicly-accessible computer-network location containing a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material, which the general network-using public has access to download anonymously at no charge using public-standard network protocols. If you use the latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated location until at least one year after the last time you distribute an Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that edition to the public.\r\n\r\nIt is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document.\r\n\r\nMODIFICATIONS\r\n\r\nYou may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy of it. In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:\r\n\r\nUse in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions (which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section of the Document). You may use the same title as a previous version if the original publisher of that version gives permission.\r\n\r\nList on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified Version, together with at least five of the principal authors of the Document (all of its principal authors, if it has less than five).\r\n\r\nState on the Title page the name of the publisher of the Modified Version, as the publisher.\r\n\r\nPreserve all the copyright notices of the Document.\r\n\r\nAdd an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications adjacent to the other copyright notices.\r\n\r\nInclude, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.\r\n\r\nPreserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections and required Cover Texts given in the Document's license notice.\r\n\r\nInclude an unaltered copy of this License.\r\n\r\nPreserve the section entitled \"History\", and its title, and add to it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page. If there is no section entitled \"History\" in the Document, create one stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified Version as stated in the previous sentence.\r\n\r\nPreserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise the network locations given in the Document for previous versions it was based on. These may be placed in the \"History\" section. You may omit a network location for a work that was published at least four years before the Document itself, or if the original publisher of the version it refers to gives permission.\r\n\r\nIn any section entitled \"Acknowledgements\" or \"Dedications\", preserve the section's title, and preserve in the section all the substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements and\/or dedications given therein.\r\n\r\nPreserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document, unaltered in their text and in their titles. Section numbers or the equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.\r\n\r\nDelete any section entitled \"Endorsements\". Such a section may not be included in the Modified Version.\r\n\r\nDo not retitle any existing section as \"Endorsements\" or to conflict in title with any Invariant Section.\r\n\r\nIf the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all of these sections as invariant. To do this, add their titles to the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's license notice. These titles must be distinct from any other section titles.\r\n\r\nYou may add a section entitled \"Endorsements\", provided it contains nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various parties--for example, statements of peer review or that the text has been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a standard.\r\n\r\nYou may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version. Only one passage of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or through arrangements made by) any one entity. If the Document already includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of, you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit permission from the previous publisher that added the old one.\r\n\r\nThe author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or imply endorsement of any Modified Version.\r\n\r\nCOMBINING DOCUMENTS\r\n\r\nYou may combine the Document with other documents released under this License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its license notice.\r\n\r\nThe combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single copy. If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but different contents, make the title of each such section unique by adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original author or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number. Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work.\r\n\r\nIn the combination, you must combine any sections entitled \"History\" in the various original documents, forming one section entitled \"History\"; likewise combine any sections entitled \"Acknowledgements\", and any sections entitled \"Dedications\". You must delete all sections entitled \"Endorsements.\"\r\n\r\nCOLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS\r\n\r\nYou may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents released under this License, and replace the individual copies of this License in the various documents with a single copy that is included in the collection, provided that you follow the rules of this License for verbatim copying of each of the documents in all other respects.\r\n\r\nYou may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow this License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of that document.\r\n\r\nAGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS\r\n\r\nA compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, does not as a whole count as a Modified Version of the Document, provided no compilation copyright is claimed for the compilation. Such a compilation is called an \"aggregate\", and this License does not apply to the other self-contained works thus compiled with the Document, on account of their being thus compiled, if they are not themselves derivative works of the Document.\r\n\r\nIf the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one quarter of the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed on covers that surround only the Document within the aggregate. Otherwise they must appear on covers around the whole aggregate.\r\n\r\nTRANSLATION\r\n\r\nTranslation is considered a kind of modification, so you may distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4. Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special permission from their copyright holders, but you may include translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the original versions of these Invariant Sections. You may include a translation of this License provided that you also include the original English version of this License. In case of a disagreement between the translation and the original English version of this License, the original English version will prevail.\r\n\r\nTERMINATION\r\n\r\nYou may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document except as expressly provided for under this License. Any other attempt to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Document is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.\r\n\r\nFUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE\r\n\r\nThe Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns. See http:\/\/www.gnu.org\/copyleft\/.\r\n\r\nEach version of the License is given a distinguishing version number. If the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this License \"or any later version\" applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that specified version or of any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation. If the Document does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose any version ever published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.\r\n\r\nHow to use this License for your documents\r\n\r\nTo use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of the License in the document and put the following copyright and license notices just after the title page:\r\n\r\nCopyright (c) YEAR YOUR NAME. Permission is granted to copy, distribute and\/or modify this document under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.1 or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation; with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with the Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts being LIST. A copy of the license is included in the section entitled \"GNU Free Documentation License\".\r\n\r\nIf you have no Invariant Sections, write \"with no Invariant Sections\" instead of saying which ones are invariant. If you have no Front-Cover Texts, write \"no Front-Cover Texts\" instead of \"Front-Cover Texts being LIST\"; likewise for Back-Cover Texts.\r\n\r\nIf your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of free software license, such as the GNU General Public License, to permit their use in free software.",

It also counts as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence the version number 2.1.]\r\n\r\nPreamble\r\n\r\nThe licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.\r\n\r\nThis license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it. You can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.\r\n\r\nWhen we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do these things.\r\n\r\nTo protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.\r\n\r\nFor example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave you. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. If you link other code with the library, you must provide complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling it. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\r\n\r\nWe protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and\/or modify the library.\r\n\r\nTo protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that there is no warranty for the free library. Also, if the library is modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know that what they have is not the original version, so that the original author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be introduced by others.\r\n\r\nFinally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of any free program. We wish to make sure that a company cannot effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a restrictive license from a patent holder. Therefore, we insist that any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.\r\n\r\nMost GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary GNU General Public License. This license, the GNU Lesser General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and is quite different from the ordinary General Public License. We use this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those libraries into non-free programs.\r\n\r\nWhen a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a combined work, a derivative of the original library. The ordinary General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the entire combination fits its criteria of freedom. The Lesser General Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with the library.\r\n\r\nWe call this license the \"Lesser\" General Public License because it does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General Public License. It also provides other free software developers Less of an advantage over competing non-free programs. These disadvantages are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many libraries. However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain special circumstances.\r\n\r\nFor example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes a de-facto standard. To achieve this, non-free programs must be allowed to use the library. A more frequent case is that a free library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries. In this case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.\r\n\r\nIn other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of free software. For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU\/Linux operating system.\r\n\r\nAlthough the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run that program using a modified version of the Library.\r\n\r\nThe precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow. Pay close attention to the difference between a \"work based on the library\" and a \"work that uses the library\". The former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must be combined with the library in order to run.\r\n\r\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\r\n\r\n0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of this Lesser General Public License (also called \"this License\"). Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".\r\n\r\nA \"library\" means a collection of software functions and\/or data prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs (which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.\r\n\r\nThe \"Library\", below, refers to any such software library or work which has been distributed under these terms. A \"work based on the Library\" means either the Library or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and\/or translated straightforwardly into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term \"modification\".)\r\n\r\n\"Source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. For a library, complete source code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the library.\r\n\r\nActivities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for writing it). Whether that is true depends on what the Library does and what the program that uses the Library does.\r\n\r\n1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the Library.\r\n\r\nYou may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\r\n\r\n2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\r\n\r\na) The modified work must itself be a software library.\r\n\r\nb) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\r\n\r\nc) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.\r\n\r\nd) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that, in the event an application does not supply such function or table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful.\r\n\r\n(For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the application. Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any application-supplied function or table used by this function must be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square root function must still compute square roots.)\r\n\r\nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\r\n\r\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on the Library.\r\n\r\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this License.\r\n\r\n3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library. To do this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2, instead of to this License. (If a newer version than version 2 of the ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify that version instead if you wish.) Do not make any other change in these notices.\r\n\r\nOnce this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.\r\n\r\nThis option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of the Library into a program that is not a library.\r\n\r\n4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange.\r\n\r\nIf distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to distribute the source code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code.\r\n\r\n5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or linked with it, is called a \"work that uses the Library\". Such a work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and therefore falls outside the scope of this License.\r\n\r\nHowever, linking a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it contains portions of the Library), rather than a \"work that uses the library\". The executable is therefore covered by this License. Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.\r\n\r\nWhen a \"work that uses the Library\" uses material from a header file that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not. Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library. The threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.\r\n\r\nIf such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative work. (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the Library will still fall under Section 6.)\r\n\r\nOtherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6. Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6, whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.\r\n\r\n6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or link a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library to produce a work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse engineering for debugging such modifications.\r\n\r\nYou must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License. You must supply a copy of this License. If the work during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference directing the user to the copy of this License. Also, you must do one of these things:\r\n\r\na) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked with the Library, with the complete machine-readable \"work that uses the Library\", as object code and\/or source code, so that the user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified executable containing the modified Library. (It is understood that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application to use the modified definitions.)\r\n\r\nb) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the Library. A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a copy of the library already present on the user's computer system, rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2) will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if the user installs one, as long as the modified version is interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.\r\n\r\nc) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give the same user the materials specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more than the cost of performing this distribution.\r\n\r\nd) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above specified materials from the same place.\r\n\r\ne) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.\r\n\r\nFor an executable, the required form of the \"work that uses the Library\" must include any data and utility programs needed for reproducing the executable from it. However, as a special exception, the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable.\r\n\r\nIt may happen that this requirement contradicts the license restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally accompany the operating system. Such a contradiction means you cannot use both them and the Library together in an executable that you distribute.\r\n\r\n7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise permitted, and provided that you do these two things:\r\n\r\na) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities. This must be distributed under the terms of the Sections above.\r\n\r\nb) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.\r\n\r\n8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.\r\n\r\n9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Library or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Library or works based on it.\r\n\r\n10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.\r\n\r\n11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Library at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.\r\n\r\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply, and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.\r\n\r\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software distribution system which is implemented by public license practices. Many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to the author\/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.\r\n\r\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of the rest of this License.\r\n\r\n12. If the distribution and\/or use of the Library is restricted in certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this License.\r\n\r\n13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and\/or new versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\r\n\r\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and \"any later version\", you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library does not specify a license version number, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.\r\n\r\n14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these, write to the author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.\r\n\r\nNO WARRANTY\r\n\r\n15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND\/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE LIBRARY IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\r\n\r\n16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND\/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\r\n\r\nEND OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\r\n\r\nHow to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries\r\n\r\nIf you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that everyone can redistribute and change. You can do so by permitting redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the ordinary General Public License).\r\n\r\nTo apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library. It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\r\n\r\none line to give the library's name and an idea of what it does.\r\nCopyright (C) year name of author\r\n\r\nThis library is free software; you can redistribute it and\/or modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.\r\n\r\nThis library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU Lesser General Public License for more details.\r\n\r\nYou should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\r\n\r\nYou should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your school, if any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the library, if necessary. Here is a sample; alter the names:\r\n\r\nYoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in\r\nthe library 'Frob' (a library for tweaking knobs) written\r\nby James Random Hacker.\r\n\r\nsignature of Ty Coon, 1 April 1990\r\nTy Coon, President of Vice\r\nThat's all there is to it!",

Note that modification of any installation\r\n    facilities provided by the Work constitutes modification of the Work.\r\n\r\n   `Current Maintainer'\r\n    A person or persons nominated as such within the Work.  If there is\r\n    no such explicit nomination then it is the `Copyright Holder' under\r\n    any applicable law.\r\n\r\n   `Base Interpreter' \r\n    A program or process that is normally needed for running or\r\n    interpreting a part or the whole of the Work.    \r\n    A Base Interpreter may depend on external components but these\r\n    are not considered part of the Base Interpreter provided that each\r\n    external component clearly identifies itself whenever it is used\r\n    interactively.  Unless explicitly specified when applying the\r\n    license to the Work, the only applicable Base Interpreter is a\r\n    \"LaTeX-Format\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONDITIONS ON DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\r\n===========================================\r\n\r\n1.  Activities other than distribution and\/or modification of the Work\r\nare not covered by this license; they are outside its scope.  In\r\nparticular, the act of running the Work is not restricted and no\r\nrequirements are made concerning any offers of support for the Work.\r\n\r\n2.  You may distribute a complete, unmodified copy of the Work as you\r\nreceived it.  Distribution of only part of the Work is considered\r\nmodification of the Work, and no right to distribute such a Derived\r\nWork may be assumed under the terms of this clause.\r\n\r\n3.  You may distribute a Compiled Work that has been generated from a\r\ncomplete, unmodified copy of the Work as distributed under Clause 2\r\nabove, as long as that Compiled Work is distributed in such a way that\r\nthe recipients may install the Compiled Work on their system exactly\r\nas it would have been installed if they generated a Compiled Work\r\ndirectly from the Work.\r\n\r\n4.  If you are the Current Maintainer of the Work, you may, without\r\nrestriction, modify the Work, thus creating a Derived Work.  You may\r\nalso distribute the Derived Work without restriction, including\r\nCompiled Works generated from the Derived Work.  Derived Works\r\ndistributed in this manner by the Current Maintainer are considered to\r\nbe updated versions of the Work.\r\n\r\n5.  If you are not the Current Maintainer of the Work, you may modify\r\nyour copy of the Work, thus creating a Derived Work based on the Work,\r\nand compile this Derived Work, thus creating a Compiled Work based on\r\nthe Derived Work.\r\n\r\n6.  If you are not the Current Maintainer of the Work, you may\r\ndistribute a Derived Work provided the following conditions are met\r\nfor every component of the Work unless that component clearly states\r\nin the copyright notice that it is exempt from that condition.  Only\r\nthe Current Maintainer is allowed to add such statements of exemption \r\nto a component of the Work. \r\n\r\n  a. If a component of this Derived Work can be a direct replacement\r\n     for a component of the Work when that component is used with the\r\n     Base Interpreter, then, wherever this component of the Work\r\n     identifies itself to the user when used interactively with that\r\n     Base Interpreter, the replacement component of this Derived Work\r\n     clearly and unambiguously identifies itself as a modified version\r\n     of this component to the user when used interactively with that\r\n     Base Interpreter.\r\n     \r\n  b. Every component of the Derived Work contains prominent notices\r\n     detailing the nature of the changes to that component, or a\r\n     prominent reference to another file that is distributed as part\r\n     of the Derived Work and that contains a complete and accurate log\r\n     of the changes.\r\n  \r\n  c. No information in the Derived Work implies that any persons,\r\n     including (but not limited to) the authors of the original version\r\n     of the Work, provide any support, including (but not limited to)\r\n     the reporting and handling of errors, to recipients of the\r\n     Derived Work unless those persons have stated explicitly that\r\n     they do provide such support for the Derived Work.\r\n\r\n  d. You distribute at least one of the following with the Derived Work:\r\n\r\n       1. A complete, unmodified copy of the Work; \r\n          if your distribution of a modified component is made by\r\n          offering access to copy the modified component from a\r\n          designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy\r\n          the Work from the same or some similar place meets this\r\n          condition, even though third parties are not compelled to\r\n          copy the Work along with the modified component;\r\n\r\n       2. Information that is sufficient to obtain a complete, unmodified\r\n          copy of the Work.\r\n\r\n7.  If you are not the Current Maintainer of the Work, you may\r\ndistribute a Compiled Work generated from a Derived Work, as long as\r\nthe Derived Work is distributed to all recipients of the Compiled\r\nWork, and as long as the conditions of Clause 6, above, are met with\r\nregard to the Derived Work.\r\n\r\n8.  The conditions above are not intended to prohibit, and hence do\r\nnot apply to, the modification, by any method, of any component so that it\r\nbecomes identical to an  updated version of that component of the Work as\r\nit is distributed by the Current Maintainer under Clause 4, above.\r\n\r\n9.  Distribution of the Work or any Derived Work in an alternative\r\nformat, where the Work or that Derived Work (in whole or in part) is\r\nthen produced by applying some process to that format, does not relax or\r\nnullify any sections of this license as they pertain to the results of\r\napplying that process.\r\n     \r\n10. a. A Derived Work may be distributed under a different license\r\n       provided that license itself honors the conditions listed in\r\n       Clause 6 above, in regard to the Work, though it does not have\r\n       to honor the rest of the conditions in this license.\r\n      \r\n    b. If a Derived Work is distributed under this license, that\r\n       Derived Work must provide sufficient documentation as part of\r\n       itself to allow each recipient of that Derived Work to honor the \r\n       restrictions in Clause 6 above, concerning changes from the Work.\r\n\r\n11. This license places no restrictions on works that are unrelated to\r\nthe Work, nor does this license place any restrictions on aggregating\r\nsuch works with the Work by any means.\r\n\r\n12.  Nothing in this license is intended to, or may be used to, prevent\r\ncomplete compliance by all parties with all applicable laws.\r\n\r\n\r\nNO WARRANTY\r\n===========\r\n\r\nThere is no warranty for the Work.  Except when otherwise stated in\r\nwriting, the Copyright Holder provides the Work `as is', without\r\nwarranty of any kind, either expressed or implied, including, but not\r\nlimited to, the implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for\r\na particular purpose.  The entire risk as to the quality and performance\r\nof the Work is with you.  Should the Work prove defective, you\r\nassume the cost of all necessary servicing, repair, or correction.\r\n\r\nIn no event unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing\r\nwill The Copyright Holder, or any author named in the components of\r\nthe Work, or any other party who may distribute and\/or modify the Work\r\nas permitted above, be liable to you for damages, including any\r\ngeneral, special, incidental or consequential damages arising out of\r\nany use of the Work or out of inability to use the Work (including,\r\nbut not limited to, loss of data, data being rendered inaccurate, or\r\nlosses sustained by anyone as a result of any failure of the Work to\r\noperate with any other programs), even if the Copyright Holder or said\r\nauthor or said other party has been advised of the possibility of such\r\ndamages.\r\n\r\n\r\nMAINTENANCE OF THE WORK\r\n=======================\r\n\r\nThe Work has the status `author-maintained' if the Copyright Holder\r\nexplicitly and prominently states near the primary copyright notice in\r\nthe Work that the Work can only be maintained by the Copyright Holder\r\nor simply that is `author-maintained'.\r\n\r\nThe Work has the status `maintained' if there is a Current Maintainer\r\nwho has indicated in the Work that they are willing to receive error\r\nreports for the Work (for example, by supplying a valid e-mail\r\naddress). It is not required for the Current Maintainer to acknowledge\r\nor act upon these error reports.\r\n\r\nThe Work changes from status `maintained' to `unmaintained' if there\r\nis no Current Maintainer, or the person stated to be Current\r\nMaintainer of the work cannot be reached through the indicated means\r\nof communication for a period of six months, and there are no other\r\nsignificant signs of active maintenance.\r\n\r\nYou can become the Current Maintainer of the Work by agreement with\r\nany existing Current Maintainer to take over this role.\r\n\r\nIf the Work is unmaintained, you can become the Current Maintainer of\r\nthe Work through the following steps:\r\n\r\n 1.  Make a reasonable attempt to trace the Current Maintainer (and\r\n     the Copyright Holder, if the two differ) through the means of\r\n     an Internet or similar search.\r\n\r\n 2.  If this search is successful, then enquire whether the Work\r\n     is still maintained.\r\n\r\n  a. If it is being maintained, then ask the Current Maintainer\r\n     to update their communication data within one month.\r\n     \r\n  b. If the search is unsuccessful or no action to resume active\r\n     maintenance is taken by the Current Maintainer, then announce\r\n     within the pertinent community your intention to take over\r\n     maintenance.  (If the Work is a LaTeX work, this could be\r\n     done, for example, by posting to comp.text.tex.)\r\n\r\n 3a. If the Current Maintainer is reachable and agrees to pass\r\n     maintenance of the Work to you, then this takes effect\r\n     immediately upon announcement.\r\n     \r\n  b. If the Current Maintainer is not reachable and the Copyright\r\n     Holder agrees that maintenance of the Work be passed to you,\r\n     then this takes effect immediately upon announcement.  \r\n    \r\n 4.  If you make an `intention announcement' as described in 2b. above\r\n     and after three months your intention is challenged neither by\r\n     the Current Maintainer nor by the Copyright Holder nor by other\r\n     people, then you may arrange for the Work to be changed so as\r\n     to name you as the (new) Current Maintainer.\r\n     \r\n 5.  If the previously unreachable Current Maintainer becomes\r\n     reachable once more within three months of a change completed\r\n     under the terms of 3b) or 4), then that Current Maintainer must\r\n     become or remain the Current Maintainer upon request provided\r\n     they then update their communication data within one month.\r\n\r\nA change in the Current Maintainer does not, of itself, alter the fact\r\nthat the Work is distributed under the LPPL license.\r\n\r\nIf you become the Current Maintainer of the Work, you should\r\nimmediately provide, within the Work, a prominent and unambiguous\r\nstatement of your status as Current Maintainer.  You should also\r\nannounce your new status to the same pertinent community as\r\nin 2b) above.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHETHER AND HOW TO DISTRIBUTE WORKS UNDER THIS LICENSE\r\n======================================================\r\n\r\nThis section contains important instructions, examples, and\r\nrecommendations for authors who are considering distributing their\r\nworks under this license.  These authors are addressed as `you' in\r\nthis section.\r\n\r\nChoosing This License or Another License\r\n----------------------------------------\r\n\r\nIf for any part of your work you want or need to use *distribution*\r\nconditions that differ significantly from those in this license, then\r\ndo not refer to this license anywhere in your work but, instead,\r\ndistribute your work under a different license.  You may use the text\r\nof this license as a model for your own license, but your license\r\nshould not refer to the LPPL or otherwise give the impression that\r\nyour work is distributed under the LPPL.\r\n\r\nThe document `modguide.tex' in the base LaTeX distribution explains\r\nthe motivation behind the conditions of this license.  It explains,\r\nfor example, why distributing LaTeX under the GNU General Public\r\nLicense (GPL) was considered inappropriate.  Even if your work is\r\nunrelated to LaTeX, the discussion in `modguide.tex' may still be\r\nrelevant, and authors intending to distribute their works under any\r\nlicense are encouraged to read it.\r\n\r\nA Recommendation on Modification Without Distribution\r\n-----------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nIt is wise never to modify a component of the Work, even for your own\r\npersonal use, without also meeting the above conditions for\r\ndistributing the modified component.  While you might intend that such\r\nmodifications will never be distributed, often this will happen by\r\naccident -- you may forget that you have modified that component; or\r\nit may not occur to you when allowing others to access the modified\r\nversion that you are thus distributing it and violating the conditions\r\nof this license in ways that could have legal implications and, worse,\r\ncause problems for the community.  It is therefore usually in your\r\nbest interest to keep your copy of the Work identical with the public\r\none.  Many works provide ways to control the behavior of that work\r\nwithout altering any of its licensed components.\r\n\r\nHow to Use This License\r\n-----------------------\r\n\r\nTo use this license, place in each of the components of your work both\r\nan explicit copyright notice including your name and the year the work\r\nwas authored and\/or last substantially modified.  Include also a\r\nstatement that the distribution and\/or modification of that\r\ncomponent is constrained by the conditions in this license.\r\n\r\nHere is an example of such a notice and statement:\r\n\r\n  %% pig.dtx\r\n  %% Copyright 2003 M. Y. Name\r\n  %\r\n  % This work may be distributed and\/or modified under the\r\n  % conditions of the LaTeX Project Public License, either version 1.3\r\n  % of this license or (at your option) any later version.\r\n  % The latest version of this license is in\r\n  %   http:\/\/www.latex-project.org\/lppl.txt\r\n  % and version 1.3 or later is part of all distributions of LaTeX\r\n  % version 2003\/12\/01 or later.\r\n  %\r\n  % This work has the LPPL maintenance status \"maintained\".\r\n  % \r\n  % This Current Maintainer of this work is M. Y. Name.\r\n  %\r\n  % This work consists of the files pig.dtx and pig.ins\r\n  % and the derived file pig.sty.\r\n\r\nGiven such a notice and statement in a file, the conditions\r\ngiven in this license document would apply, with the `Work' referring\r\nto the three files `pig.dtx', `pig.ins', and `pig.sty' (the last being\r\ngenerated from `pig.dtx' using `pig.ins'), the `Base Interpreter'\r\nreferring to any \"LaTeX-Format\", and both `Copyright Holder' and\r\n`Current Maintainer' referring to the person `M. Y. Name'.\r\n\r\nIf you do not want the Maintenance section of LPPL to apply to your\r\nWork, change \"maintained\" above into \"author-maintained\".  \r\nHowever, we recommend that you use \"maintained\" as the Maintenance\r\nsection was added in order to ensure that your Work remains useful to\r\nthe community even when you can no longer maintain and support it\r\nyourself.\r\n\r\n\r\nImportant Recommendations\r\n-------------------------\r\n\r\n Defining What Constitutes the Work\r\n\r\n   The LPPL requires that distributions of the Work contain all the\r\n   files of the Work.  It is therefore important that you provide a\r\n   way for the licensee to determine which files constitute the Work.\r\n   This could, for example, be achieved by explicitly listing all the\r\n   files of the Work near the copyright notice of each file or by\r\n   using a line such as:\r\n\r\n    % This work consists of all files listed in manifest.txt.\r\n   \r\n   in that place.  In the absence of an unequivocal list it might be\r\n   impossible for the licensee to determine what is considered by you\r\n   to comprise the Work and, in such a case, the licensee would be\r\n   entitled to make reasonable conjectures as to which files comprise\r\n   the Work.\r\n",

The aggregate work shall contain a notice specifying the inclusion of the Open Publication material and appropriate copyright notice. \r\n\r\nSEVERABILITY. If any part of this license is found to be unenforceable in any jurisdiction, the remaining portions of the license remain in force. \r\n\r\nNO WARRANTY. Open Publication works are licensed and provided \"as is\" without warranty of any kind, express or implied, including, but not limited to, the implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose or a warranty of non-infringement. \r\n\r\n\r\nIV. REQUIREMENTS ON MODIFIED WORKS \r\n\r\nAll modified versions of documents covered by this license, including translations, anthologies, compilations and partial documents, must meet the following requirements:\r\nThe modified version must be labeled as such.\r\nThe person making the modifications must be identified and the modifications dated.\r\nAcknowledgement of the original author and publisher if applicable must be retained according to normal academic citation practices.\r\nThe location of the original unmodified document must be identified.\r\nThe original author's (or authors') name(s) may not be used to assert or imply endorsement of the resulting document without the original author's (or authors') permission.\r\n\r\nV. GOOD-PRACTICE RECOMMENDATIONS \r\n\r\nIn addition to the requirements of this license, it is requested from and strongly recommended of redistributors that:\r\nIf you are distributing Open Publication works on hardcopy or CD-ROM, you provide email notification to the authors of your intent to redistribute at least thirty days before your manuscript or media freeze, to give the authors time to provide updated documents. This notification should describe modifications, if any, made to the document.\r\nAll substantive modifications (including deletions) be either clearly marked up in the document or else described in an attachment to the document.\r\nFinally, while it is not mandatory under this license, it is considered good form to offer a free copy of any hardcopy and CD-ROM expression of an Open Publication-licensed work to its author(s).\r\n\r\nVI. LICENSE OPTIONS \r\n\r\nThe author(s) and\/or publisher of an Open Publication-licensed document may elect certain options by appending language to the reference to or copy of the license. These options are considered part of the license instance and must be included with the license (or its incorporation by reference) in derived works. \r\n\r\nA. To prohibit distribution of substantively modified versions without the explicit permission of the author(s). \"Substantive modification\" is defined as a change to the semantic content of the document, and excludes mere changes in format or typographical corrections. \r\n\r\nTo accomplish this, add the phrase `Distribution of substantively modified versions of this document is prohibited without the explicit permission of the copyright holder.' to the license reference or copy. \r\n\r\nB. To prohibit any publication of this work or derivative works in whole or in part in standard (paper) book form for commercial purposes unless prior permission is obtained from the copyright holder. \r\n\r\nTo accomplish this, add the phrase 'Distribution of the work or derivative of the work in any standard (paper) book form is prohibited unless prior permission is obtained from the copyright holder.' to the license reference or copy.

HISTORY OF THE SOFTWARE\r\n==========================\r\n\r\nPython was created in the early 1990s by Guido van Rossum at Stichting\r\nMathematisch Centrum (CWI, see http:\/\/www.cwi.nl) in the Netherlands\r\nas a successor of a language called ABC.  Guido remains Python's\r\nprincipal author, although it includes many contributions from others.\r\n\r\nIn 1995, Guido continued his work on Python at the Corporation for\r\nNational Research Initiatives (CNRI, see http:\/\/www.cnri.reston.va.us)\r\nin Reston, Virginia where he released several versions of the\r\nsoftware.\r\n\r\nIn May 2000, Guido and the Python core development team moved to\r\nBeOpen.com to form the BeOpen PythonLabs team.  In October of the same\r\nyear, the PythonLabs team moved to Digital Creations (now Zope\r\nCorporation, see http:\/\/www.zope.com).  In 2001, the Python Software\r\nFoundation (PSF, see http:\/\/www.python.org\/psf\/) was formed, a\r\nnon-profit organization created specifically to own Python-related\r\nIntellectual Property.  Zope Corporation is a sponsoring member of\r\nthe PSF.\r\n\r\nAll Python releases are Open Source (see http:\/\/www.opensource.org for\r\nthe Open Source Definition).  Historically, most, but not all, Python\r\nreleases have also been GPL-compatible; the table below summarizes\r\nthe various releases.\r\n\r\n    Release         Derived     Year        Owner       GPL-\r\n\t\t    from                                compatible?

All Python licenses, unlike the GPL, let you distribute\r\n    a modified version without making your changes open source.  The\r\n    GPL-compatible licenses make it possible to combine Python with\r\n    other software that is released under the GPL; the others don't.\r\n\r\nThanks to the many outside volunteers who have worked under Guido's\r\ndirection to make these releases possible.\r\n\r\n\r\nB.

Contributor Grant. \r\nSubject to third party intellectual property claims, each Contributor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive license\r\n\r\n(a) under intellectual property rights (other than patent or trademark) Licensable by Contributor, to use, reproduce, modify, display, perform, sublicense and distribute the Modifications created by such Contributor (or portions thereof) either on an unmodified basis, with other Modifications, as Covered Code and\/or as part of a Larger Work; and\r\n(b) under Patent Claims infringed by the making, using, or selling of Modifications made by that Contributor either alone and\/or in combination with its Contributor Version (or portions of such combination), to make, use, sell, offer for sale, have made, and\/or otherwise dispose of: 1) Modifications made by that Contributor (or portions thereof); and 2) the combination of Modifications made by that Contributor with its Contributor Version (or portions of such combination).\r\n\r\n(c) the licenses granted in Sections 2.2(a) and 2.2(b) are effective on the date Contributor first makes Commercial Use of the Covered Code.\r\n\r\n(d) Notwithstanding Section 2.2(b) above, no patent license is granted: 1) for any code that Contributor has deleted from the Contributor Version; 2) separate from the Contributor Version; 3) for infringements caused by: i) third party modifications of Contributor Version or ii) the combination of Modifications made by that Contributor with other software (except as part of the Contributor Version) or other devices; or 4) under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Code in the absence of Modifications made by that Contributor.\r\n\r\n\r\n3. Distribution Obligations.\r\n\r\n3.1. Application of License. \r\nThe Modifications which You create or to which You contribute are governed by the terms of this License, including without limitation Section 2.2. The Source Code version of Covered Code may be distributed only under the terms of this License or a future version of this License released under Section 6.1, and You must include a copy of this License with every copy of the Source Code You distribute. You may not offer or impose any terms on any Source Code version that alters or restricts the applicable version of this License or the recipients' rights hereunder. However, You may include an additional document offering the additional rights described in Section 3.5.\r\n3.2. Availability of Source Code. \r\nAny Modification which You create or to which You contribute must be made available in Source Code form under the terms of this License either on the same media as an Executable version or via an accepted Electronic Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom you made an Executable version available; and if made available via Electronic Distribution Mechanism, must remain available for at least twelve (12) months after the date it initially became available, or at least six (6) months after a subsequent version of that particular Modification has been made available to such recipients. You are responsible for ensuring that the Source Code version remains available even if the Electronic Distribution Mechanism is maintained by a third party.\r\n\r\n3.3. Description of Modifications. \r\nYou must cause all Covered Code to which You contribute to contain a file documenting the changes You made to create that Covered Code and the date of any change. You must include a prominent statement that the Modification is derived, directly or indirectly, from Original Code provided by the Initial Developer and including the name of the Initial Developer in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in any notice in an Executable version or related documentation in which You describe the origin or ownership of the Covered Code.\r\n\r\n3.4. Intellectual Property Matters\r\n\r\n(a) Third Party Claims. \r\nIf Contributor has knowledge that a license under a third party's intellectual property rights is required to exercise the rights granted by such Contributor under Sections 2.1 or 2.2, Contributor must include a text file with the Source Code distribution titled \"LEGAL'' which describes the claim and the party making the claim in sufficient detail that a recipient will know whom to contact. If Contributor obtains such knowledge after the Modification is made available as described in Section 3.2, Contributor shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies Contributor makes available thereafter and shall take other steps (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably calculated to inform those who received the Covered Code that new knowledge has been obtained.\r\n(b) Contributor APIs. \r\nIf Contributor's Modifications include an application programming interface and Contributor has knowledge of patent licenses which are reasonably necessary to implement that API, Contributor must also include this information in the LEGAL file. \r\n(c) Representations.\r\nContributor represents that, except as disclosed pursuant to Section 3.4(a) above, Contributor believes that Contributor's Modifications are Contributor's original creation(s) and\/or Contributor has sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by this License.\r\n\r\n3.5. Required Notices. \r\nYou must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source Code. If it is not possible to put such notice in a particular Source Code file due to its structure, then You must include such notice in a location (such as a relevant directory) where a user would be likely to look for such a notice. If You created one or more Modification(s) You may add your name as a Contributor to the notice described in Exhibit A. You must also duplicate this License in any documentation for the Source Code where You describe recipients' rights or ownership rights relating to Covered Code. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Code. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear than any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.\r\n\r\n3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions. \r\nYou may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the requirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered Code, and if You include a notice stating that the Source Code version of the Covered Code is available under the terms of this License, including a description of how and where You have fulfilled the obligations of Section 3.2. The notice must be conspicuously included in any notice in an Executable version, related documentation or collateral in which You describe recipients' rights relating to the Covered Code. You may distribute the Executable version of Covered Code or ownership rights under a license of Your choice, which may contain terms different from this License, provided that You are in compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the Executable version does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient's rights in the Source Code version from the rights set forth in this License. If You distribute the Executable version under a different license You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ from this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such terms You offer.\r\n\r\n3.7. Larger Works. \r\nYou may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other code not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code.\r\n\r\n4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.\r\nIf it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License with respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must be included in the LEGAL file described in Section 3.4 and must be included with all distributions of the Source Code. Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.\r\n\r\n5. Application of this License.\r\nThis License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has attached the notice in Exhibit A and to related Covered Code.\r\n\r\n6. Versions of the License.\r\n6.1. New Versions. \r\nSugarCRM Inc. (''SugarCRM'') may publish revised and\/or new versions of the License from time to time. Each version will be given a distinguishing version number.\r\n6.2. Effect of New Versions. \r\nOnce Covered Code has been published under a particular version of the License, You may always continue to use it under the terms of that version. You may also choose to use such Covered Code under the terms of any subsequent version of the License published by SugarCRM. No one other than SugarCRM has the right to modify the terms applicable to Covered Code created under this License.\r\n\r\n6.3. Derivative Works. \r\nIf You create or use a modified version of this License (which you may only do in order to apply it to code which is not already Covered Code governed by this License), You must (a) rename Your license so that the phrases ''SugarCRM'', ''SPL'' or any confusingly similar phrase do not appear in your license (except to note that your license differs from this License) and (b) otherwise make it clear that Your version of the license contains terms which differ from the SugarCRM Public License. (Filling in the name of the Initial Developer, Original Code or Contributor in the notice described in Exhibit A shall not of themselves be deemed to be modifications of this License.)\r\n\r\n7. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.\r\nCOVERED CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN \"AS IS'' BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED CODE IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED CODE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED CODE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED CODE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.\r\n\r\n8. TERMINATION.\r\n8.1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. All sublicenses to the Covered Code which are properly granted shall survive any termination of this License. Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License shall survive.\r\n8.2. If You initiate litigation by asserting a patent infringement claim (excluding declatory judgment actions) against Initial Developer or a Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom You file such action is referred to as \"Participant\") alleging that:\r\n\r\n(a) such Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted by such Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and\/or 2.2 of this License shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate prospectively, unless if within 60 days after receipt of notice You either: (i) agree in writing to pay Participant a mutually agreeable reasonable royalty for Your past and future use of Modifications made by such Participant, or (ii) withdraw Your litigation claim with respect to the Contributor Version against such Participant. If within 60 days of notice, a reasonable royalty and payment arrangement are not mutually agreed upon in writing by the parties or the litigation claim is not withdrawn, the rights granted by Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and\/or 2.2 automatically terminate at the expiration of the 60 day notice period specified above.\r\n\r\n(b) any software, hardware, or device, other than such Participant's Contributor Version, directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any rights granted to You by such Participant under Sections 2.1(b) and 2.2(b) are revoked effective as of the date You first made, used, sold, distributed, or had made, Modifications made by that Participant.\r\n\r\n8.3. If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant alleging that such Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as by license or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses granted by such Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken into account in determining the amount or value of any payment or license.\r\n\r\n8.4. In the event of termination under Sections 8.1 or 8.2 above, all end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder prior to termination shall survive termination.\r\n\r\n9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.\r\nUNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED CODE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\r\n\r\n10. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.\r\nThe Covered Code is a ''commercial item,'' as that term is defined in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of ''commercial computer software'' and ''commercial computer software documentation,'' as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Code with only those rights set forth herein.\r\n\r\n11. MISCELLANEOUS.\r\nThis License represents the complete agreement concerning subject matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be governed by California law provisions (except to the extent applicable law, if any, provides otherwise), excluding its conflict-of-law provisions. With respect to disputes in which at least one party is a citizen of, or an entity chartered or registered to do business in the United States of America, any litigation relating to this License shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Courts of the Northern District of California, with venue lying in Santa Clara County, California, with the losing party responsible for costs, including without limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not apply to this License.\r\n\r\n12. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.\r\nAs between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly, out of its utilization of rights under this License and You agree to work with Initial Developer and Contributors to distribute such responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing herein is intended or shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability.\r\n\r\n13. MULTIPLE-LICENSED CODE.\r\nInitial Developer may designate portions of the Covered Code as \u201cMultiple-Licensed\u201d. \u201cMultiple-Licensed\u201d means that the Initial Developer permits you to utilize portions of the Covered Code under Your choice of the SPL or the alternative licenses, if any, specified by the Initial Developer in the file described in Exhibit A.\r\nSugarCRM Public License 1.1.3 - Exhibit A\r\n\r\nThe contents of this file are subject to the SugarCRM Public License Version 1.1.3\r\n(\"License\"); You may not use this file except in compliance with the \r\nLicense.

Only the\r\nLicensor offering said maintenance and\/or technical assistance services\r\nshall incur liability therefor.\r\n\r\n7.2 Similarly, any Licensor is entitled to offer to its licensees, under\r\nits sole responsibility, a warranty, that shall only be binding upon\r\nitself, for the redistribution of the Software and\/or the Modified\r\nSoftware, under terms and conditions that it is free to decide. Said\r\nwarranty, and the financial terms and conditions of its application,\r\nshall be subject of a separate instrument executed between the Licensor\r\nand the Licensee.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Article 8 - LIABILITY\r\n\r\n8.1 Subject to the provisions of Article 8.2, the Licensee shall be\r\nentitled to claim compensation for any direct loss it may have suffered\r\nfrom the Software as a result of a fault on the part of the relevant\r\nLicensor, subject to providing evidence thereof.\r\n\r\n8.2 The Licensor's liability is limited to the commitments made under\r\nthis Agreement and shall not be incurred as a result of in particular:\r\n(i) loss due the Licensee's total or partial failure to fulfill its\r\nobligations, (ii) direct or consequential loss that is suffered by the\r\nLicensee due to the use or performance of the Software, and (iii) more\r\ngenerally, any consequential loss. In particular the Parties expressly\r\nagree that any or all pecuniary or business loss (i.e. loss of data,\r\nloss of profits, operating loss, loss of customers or orders,\r\nopportunity cost, any disturbance to business activities) or any or all\r\nlegal proceedings instituted against the Licensee by a third party,\r\nshall constitute consequential loss and shall not provide entitlement to\r\nany or all compensation from the Licensor.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Article 9 - WARRANTY\r\n\r\n9.1 The Licensee acknowledges that the scientific and technical\r\nstate-of-the-art when the Software was distributed did not enable all\r\npossible uses to be tested and verified, nor for the presence of\r\npossible defects to be detected. In this respect, the Licensee's\r\nattention has been drawn to the risks associated with loading, using,\r\nmodifying and\/or developing and reproducing the Software which are\r\nreserved for experienced users.\r\n\r\nThe Licensee shall be responsible for verifying, by any or all means,\r\nthe suitability of the product for its requirements, its good working\r\norder, and for ensuring that it shall not cause damage to either persons\r\nor properties.\r\n\r\n9.2 The Licensor hereby represents, in good faith, that it is entitled\r\nto grant all the rights over the Software (including in particular the\r\nrights set forth in Article 5).\r\n\r\n9.3 The Licensee acknowledges that the Software is supplied \"as is\" by\r\nthe Licensor without any other express or tacit warranty, other than\r\nthat provided for in Article 9.2 and, in particular, without any warranty\r\nas to its commercial value, its secured, safe, innovative or relevant\r\nnature.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, the Licensor does not warrant that the Software is free\r\nfrom any error, that it will operate without interruption, that it will\r\nbe compatible with the Licensee's own equipment and software\r\nconfiguration, nor that it will meet the Licensee's requirements.\r\n\r\n9.4 The Licensor does not either expressly or tacitly warrant that the\r\nSoftware does not infringe any third party intellectual property right\r\nrelating to a patent, software or any other property right. Therefore,\r\nthe Licensor disclaims any and all liability towards the Licensee\r\narising out of any or all proceedings for infringement that may be\r\ninstituted in respect of the use, modification and redistribution of the\r\nSoftware. Nevertheless, should such proceedings be instituted against\r\nthe Licensee, the Licensor shall provide it with technical and legal\r\nassistance for its defense. Such technical and legal assistance shall be\r\ndecided on a case-by-case basis between the relevant Licensor and the\r\nLicensee pursuant to a memorandum of understanding. The Licensor\r\ndisclaims any and all liability as regards the Licensee's use of the\r\nname of the Software. No warranty is given as regards the existence of\r\nprior rights over the name of the Software or as regards the existence\r\nof a trademark.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Article 10 - TERMINATION\r\n\r\n10.1 In the event of a breach by the Licensee of its obligations\r\nhereunder, the Licensor may automatically terminate this Agreement\r\nthirty (30) days after notice has been sent to the Licensee and has\r\nremained ineffective.\r\n\r\n10.2 A Licensee whose Agreement is terminated shall no longer be\r\nauthorized to use, modify or distribute the Software. However, any\r\nlicenses that it may have granted prior to termination of the Agreement\r\nshall remain valid subject to their having been granted in compliance\r\nwith the terms and conditions hereof.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Article 11 - MISCELLANEOUS\r\n\r\n\r\n      11.1 EXCUSABLE EVENTS\r\n\r\nNeither Party shall be liable for any or all delay, or failure to\r\nperform the Agreement, that may be attributable to an event of force\r\nmajeure, an act of God or an outside cause, such as defective\r\nfunctioning or interruptions of the electricity or telecommunications\r\nnetworks, network paralysis following a virus attack, intervention by\r\ngovernment authorities, natural disasters, water damage, earthquakes,\r\nfire, explosions, strikes and labor unrest, war, etc.\r\n\r\n11.2 Any failure by either Party, on one or more occasions, to invoke\r\none or more of the provisions hereof, shall under no circumstances be\r\ninterpreted as being a waiver by the interested Party of its right to\r\ninvoke said provision(s) subsequently.\r\n\r\n11.3 The Agreement cancels and replaces any or all previous agreements,\r\nwhether written or oral, between the Parties and having the same\r\npurpose, and constitutes the entirety of the agreement between said\r\nParties concerning said purpose. No supplement or modification to the\r\nterms and conditions hereof shall be effective as between the Parties\r\nunless it is made in writing and signed by their duly authorized\r\nrepresentatives.\r\n\r\n11.4 In the event that one or more of the provisions hereof were to\r\nconflict with a current or future applicable act or legislative text,\r\nsaid act or legislative text shall prevail, and the Parties shall make\r\nthe necessary amendments so as to comply with said act or legislative\r\ntext. All other provisions shall remain effective. Similarly, invalidity\r\nof a provision of the Agreement, for any reason whatsoever, shall not\r\ncause the Agreement as a whole to be invalid.\r\n\r\n\r\n      11.5 LANGUAGE\r\n\r\nThe Agreement is drafted in both French and English and both versions\r\nare deemed authentic.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Article 12 - NEW VERSIONS OF THE AGREEMENT\r\n\r\n12.1 Any person is authorized to duplicate and distribute copies of this\r\nAgreement.\r\n\r\n12.2 So as to ensure coherence, the wording of this Agreement is\r\nprotected and may only be modified by the authors of the License, who\r\nreserve the right to periodically publish updates or new versions of the\r\nAgreement, each with a separate number. These subsequent versions may\r\naddress new issues encountered by Free Software.\r\n\r\n12.3 Any Software distributed under a given version of the Agreement may\r\nonly be subsequently distributed under the same version of the Agreement\r\nor a subsequent version.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Article 13 - GOVERNING LAW AND JURISDICTION\r\n\r\n13.1 The Agreement is governed by French law. The Parties agree to\r\nendeavor to seek an amicable solution to any disagreements or disputes\r\nthat may arise during the performance of the Agreement.\r\n\r\n13.2 Failing an amicable solution within two (2) months as from their\r\noccurrence, and unless emergency proceedings are necessary, the\r\ndisagreements or disputes shall be referred to the Paris Courts having\r\njurisdiction, by the more diligent Party.\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion 1.0 dated 2006-09-05.",

ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.\r\n\r\n1. DEFINITIONS\r\n\r\n\"Contribution\" means:\r\n\r\na) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial code and documentation distributed under this Agreement, and\r\n\r\nb) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:\r\n\r\ni) changes to the Program, and\r\n\r\nii) additions to the Program;\r\n\r\nwhere such changes and\/or additions to the Program originate from and are distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution 'originates' from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor's behalf. Contributions do not include additions to the Program which: (i) are separate modules of software distributed in conjunction with the Program under their own license agreement, and (ii) are not derivative works of the Program.\r\n\r\n\"Contributor\" means any person or entity that distributes the Program.\r\n\r\n\"Licensed Patents \" mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone or when combined with the Program.\r\n\r\n\"Program\" means the Contributions distributed in accordance with this Agreement.\r\n\r\n\"Recipient\" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement, including all Contributors.\r\n\r\n2. GRANT OF RIGHTS\r\n\r\na) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, and such derivative works, in source code and object code form.\r\n\r\nb) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in source code and object code form. This patent license shall apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is licensed hereunder.\r\n\r\nc) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity. Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party patent license is required to allow Recipient to distribute the Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license before distributing the Program.\r\n\r\nd) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright license set forth in this Agreement.\r\n\r\n3. REQUIREMENTS\r\n\r\nA Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form under its own license agreement, provided that:\r\n\r\na) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and\r\n\r\nb) its license agreement:\r\n\r\ni) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties and conditions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose;\r\n\r\nii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits;\r\n\r\niii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are offered by that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and\r\n\r\niv) states that source code for the Program is available from such Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily used for software exchange.\r\n\r\nWhen the Program is made available in source code form:\r\n\r\na) it must be made available under this Agreement; and\r\n\r\nb) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the Program.\r\n\r\nContributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained within the Program.\r\n\r\nEach Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its Contribution, if any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent Recipients to identify the originator of the Contribution.\r\n\r\n4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION\r\n\r\nCommercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner which does not create potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering, such Contributor (\"Commercial Contributor\") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every other Contributor (\"Indemnified Contributor\") against any losses, damages and costs (collectively \"Losses\") arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program in a commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such claim at its own expense.\r\n\r\nFor example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims against the other Contributors related to those performance claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay those damages.\r\n\r\n5. NO WARRANTY\r\n\r\nEXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN \"AS IS\" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement, including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.\r\n\r\n6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY\r\n\r\nEXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\r\n\r\n7. GENERAL\r\n\r\nIf any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.\r\n\r\nIf Recipient institutes patent litigation against a Contributor with respect to a patent applicable to software (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit), then any patent licenses granted by that Contributor to such Recipient under this Agreement shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed. In addition, If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software or hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.\r\n\r\nAll Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable. However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement and any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and survive.\r\n\r\nEveryone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement, but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and may only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward reserves the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement from time to time. No one other than the Agreement Steward has the right to modify this Agreement. IBM is the initial Agreement Steward. IBM may assign the responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate entity. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing version number. The Program (including Contributions) may always be distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which it was received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is published, Contributor may elect to distribute the Program (including its Contributions) under the new version. Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual property of any Contributor under this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved.\r\n\r\nThis Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and the intellectual property laws of the United States of America. No party to this Agreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement more than one year after the cause of action arose. Each party waives its rights to a jury trial in any resulting litigation.\r\n",

Contributions do not include additions to the Program which: (i) are separate modules of software distributed in conjunction with the Program under their own license agreement, and (ii) are not derivative works of the Program.\r\n\"Contributor\" means any person or entity that distributes the Program.\r\n\r\n\"Licensed Patents\" mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone or when combined with the Program.\r\n\r\n\"Program\" means the Contributions distributed in accordance with this Agreement.\r\n\r\n\"Recipient\" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement, including all Contributors.\r\n\r\n2. GRANT OF RIGHTS\r\n\r\na) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, and such derivative works, in source code and object code form.\r\nb) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in source code and object code form. This patent license shall apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is licensed hereunder.\r\nc) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity. Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party patent license is required to allow Recipient to distribute the Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license before distributing the Program.\r\nd) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright license set forth in this Agreement.\r\n3. REQUIREMENTS\r\n\r\nA Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form under its own license agreement, provided that:\r\n\r\na) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and\r\nb) its license agreement:\r\ni) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties and conditions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose;\r\nii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits;\r\niii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are offered by that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and\r\niv) states that source code for the Program is available from such Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily used for software exchange.\r\nWhen the Program is made available in source code form:\r\n\r\na) it must be made available under this Agreement; and\r\nb) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the Program.\r\nContributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained within the Program.\r\n\r\nEach Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its Contribution, if any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent Recipients to identify the originator of the Contribution.\r\n\r\n4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION\r\n\r\nCommercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner which does not create potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering, such Contributor (\"Commercial Contributor\") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every other Contributor (\"Indemnified Contributor\") against any losses, damages and costs (collectively \"Losses\") arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program in a commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such claim at its own expense.\r\n\r\nFor example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims against the other Contributors related to those performance claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay those damages.\r\n\r\n5. NO WARRANTY\r\n\r\nEXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN \"AS IS\" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement , including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.\r\n\r\n6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY\r\n\r\nEXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\r\n\r\n7. GENERAL\r\n\r\nIf any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.\r\n\r\nIf Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software or hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.\r\n\r\nAll Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable. However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement and any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and survive.\r\n\r\nEveryone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement, but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and may only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward reserves the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement from time to time. No one other than the Agreement Steward has the right to modify this Agreement. The Eclipse Foundation is the initial Agreement Steward. The Eclipse Foundation may assign the responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate entity. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing version number. The Program (including Contributions) may always be distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which it was received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is published, Contributor may elect to distribute the Program (including its Contributions) under the new version. Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual property of any Contributor under this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved.\r\n\r\nThis Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and the intellectual property laws of the United States of America. No party to this Agreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement more than one year after the cause of action arose. Each party waives its rights to a jury trial in any resulting litigation.",

Distribution Obligations.\r\n\r\n3.1. Application of License. \r\nThe Modifications which You create or to which You contribute are governed by the terms of this License, including without limitation Section 2.2. The Source Code version of Covered Code may be distributed only under the terms of this License or a future version of this License released under Section 6.1, and You must include a copy of this License with every copy of the Source Code You distribute. You may not offer or impose any terms on any Source Code version that alters or restricts the applicable version of this License or the recipients' rights hereunder. However, You may include an additional document offering the additional rights described in Section 3.5.\r\n3.2. Availability of Source Code. \r\nAny Modification which You create or to which You contribute must be made available in Source Code form under the terms of this License either on the same media as an Executable version or via an accepted Electronic Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom you made an Executable version available; and if made available via Electronic Distribution Mechanism, must remain available for at least twelve (12) months after the date it initially became available, or at least six (6) months after a subsequent version of that particular Modification has been made available to such recipients. You are responsible for ensuring that the Source Code version remains available even if the Electronic Distribution Mechanism is maintained by a third party.\r\n\r\n3.3. Description of Modifications. \r\nYou must cause all Covered Code to which You contribute to contain a file documenting the changes You made to create that Covered Code and the date of any change. You must include a prominent statement that the Modification is derived, directly or indirectly, from Original Code provided by the Initial Developer and including the name of the Initial Developer in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in any notice in an Executable version or related documentation in which You describe the origin or ownership of the Covered Code.\r\n\r\n3.4. Intellectual Property Matters\r\n\r\n(a) Third Party Claims. \r\nIf Contributor has knowledge that a license under a third party's intellectual property rights is required to exercise the rights granted by such Contributor under Sections 2.1 or 2.2, Contributor must include a text file with the Source Code distribution titled \"LEGAL'' which describes the claim and the party making the claim in sufficient detail that a recipient will know whom to contact. If Contributor obtains such knowledge after the Modification is made available as described in Section 3.2, Contributor shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies Contributor makes available thereafter and shall take other steps (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably calculated to inform those who received the Covered Code that new knowledge has been obtained.\r\n(b) Contributor APIs. \r\nIf Contributor's Modifications include an application programming interface and Contributor has knowledge of patent licenses which are reasonably necessary to implement that API, Contributor must also include this information in the LEGAL file. \r\n \r\n\r\n          (c)    Representations.\r\nContributor represents that, except as disclosed pursuant to Section 3.4(a) above, Contributor believes that Contributor's Modifications are Contributor's original creation(s) and\/or Contributor has sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by this License.\r\n\r\n3.5. Required Notices. \r\nYou must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source Code.  If it is not possible to put such notice in a particular Source Code file due to its structure, then You must include such notice in a location (such as a relevant directory) where a user would be likely to look for such a notice.  If You created one or more Modification(s) You may add your name as a Contributor to the notice described in Exhibit A.  You must also duplicate this License in any documentation for the Source Code where You describe recipients' rights or ownership rights relating to Covered Code.  You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Code. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear than any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.\r\n\r\n3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions. \r\nYou may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the requirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered Code, and if You include a notice stating that the Source Code version of the Covered Code is available under the terms of this License, including a description of how and where You have fulfilled the obligations of Section 3.2. The notice must be conspicuously included in any notice in an Executable version, related documentation or collateral in which You describe recipients' rights relating to the Covered Code. You may distribute the Executable version of Covered Code or ownership rights under a license of Your choice, which may contain terms different from this License, provided that You are in compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the Executable version does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient's rights in the Source Code version from the rights set forth in this License. If You distribute the Executable version under a different license You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ from this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such terms You offer.\r\n\r\n3.7. Larger Works. \r\nYou may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other code not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code.\r\n\r\n4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.\r\nIf it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License with respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must be included in the LEGAL file described in Section 3.4 and must be included with all distributions of the Source Code. Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.\r\n5. Application of this License.\r\nThis License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has attached the notice in Exhibit A and to related Covered Code.\r\n6. Versions of the License.\r\n6.1. New Versions. \r\nNetscape Communications Corporation (''Netscape'') may publish revised and\/or new versions of the License from time to time. Each version will be given a distinguishing version number.\r\n6.2. Effect of New Versions. \r\nOnce Covered Code has been published under a particular version of the License, You may always continue to use it under the terms of that version. You may also choose to use such Covered Code under the terms of any subsequent version of the License published by Netscape. No one other than Netscape has the right to modify the terms applicable to Covered Code created under this License.\r\n\r\n6.3. Derivative Works. \r\nIf You create or use a modified version of this License (which you may only do in order to apply it to code which is not already Covered Code governed by this License), You must (a) rename Your license so that the phrases ''Mozilla'', ''MOZILLAPL'', ''MOZPL'', ''Netscape'', \"MPL\", ''NPL'' or any confusingly similar phrase do not appear in your license (except to note that your license differs from this License) and (b) otherwise make it clear that Your version of the license contains terms which differ from the Mozilla Public License and Netscape Public License. (Filling in the name of the Initial Developer, Original Code or Contributor in the notice described in Exhibit A shall not of themselves be deemed to be modifications of this License.)\r\n\r\n7. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.\r\nCOVERED CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN \"AS IS'' BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED CODE IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED CODE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED CODE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED CODE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.\r\n8. TERMINATION.\r\n8.1.  This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. All sublicenses to the Covered Code which are properly granted shall survive any termination of this License. Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License shall survive.\r\n8.2.  If You initiate litigation by asserting a patent infringement claim (excluding declatory judgment actions) against Initial Developer or a Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom You file such action is referred to as \"Participant\")  alleging that:\r\n\r\n(a)  such Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted by such Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and\/or 2.2 of this License shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate prospectively, unless if within 60 days after receipt of notice You either: (i)  agree in writing to pay Participant a mutually agreeable reasonable royalty for Your past and future use of Modifications made by such Participant, or (ii) withdraw Your litigation claim with respect to the Contributor Version against such Participant.  If within 60 days of notice, a reasonable royalty and payment arrangement are not mutually agreed upon in writing by the parties or the litigation claim is not withdrawn, the rights granted by Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and\/or 2.2 automatically terminate at the expiration of the 60 day notice period specified above.\r\n\r\n(b)  any software, hardware, or device, other than such Participant's Contributor Version, directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any rights granted to You by such Participant under Sections 2.1(b) and 2.2(b) are revoked effective as of the date You first made, used, sold, distributed, or had made, Modifications made by that Participant.\r\n\r\n8.3.  If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant alleging that such Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as by license or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses granted by such Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken into account in determining the amount or value of any payment or license.\r\n\r\n8.4.  In the event of termination under Sections 8.1 or 8.2 above,  all end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder prior to termination shall survive termination.\r\n\r\n9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.\r\nUNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED CODE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\r\n10. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.\r\nThe Covered Code is a ''commercial item,'' as that term is defined in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of ''commercial computer software'' and ''commercial computer software documentation,'' as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Code with only those rights set forth herein.\r\n11. MISCELLANEOUS.\r\nThis License represents the complete agreement concerning subject matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be governed by California law provisions (except to the extent applicable law, if any, provides otherwise), excluding its conflict-of-law provisions. With respect to disputes in which at least one party is a citizen of, or an entity chartered or registered to do business in the United States of America, any litigation relating to this License shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Courts of the Northern District of California, with venue lying in Santa Clara County, California, with the losing party responsible for costs, including without limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not apply to this License.\r\n12. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.\r\nAs between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly, out of its utilization of rights under this License and You agree to work with Initial Developer and Contributors to distribute such responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing herein is intended or shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability.\r\n13. MULTIPLE-LICENSED CODE.\r\nInitial Developer may designate portions of the Covered Code as ?Multiple-Licensed?.  ?Multiple-Licensed? means that the Initial Developer permits you to utilize portions of the Covered Code under Your choice of the NPL or the alternative licenses, if any, specified by the Initial Developer in the file described in Exhibit A.\r\n\r\nEXHIBIT A -Mozilla Public License.\r\n\r\n``The contents of this file are subject to the Mozilla Public License Version 1.1 (the \"License\"); you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.

This occurred\r\nany time an entity did not release their application to a \"third party\".\r\n\r\nWhile there is a certain freedom in this model of licensing, it struck the\r\nauthors of the RPL as being unfair to the open source community at large and to\r\nthe original authors of the works in particular. After all, bug fixes,\r\nextensions, and meaningful and valuable derivatives were not consistently\r\nfinding their way back into the community where they could fuel further, and\r\nfaster, growth and expansion of the overall open source software base.\r\n\r\nWhile you should clearly read and understand the entire license, the essence of\r\nthe RPL is found in two definitions: \"Deploy\" and \"Required Components\".\r\n\r\nRegarding deployment, under the RPL your changes, bug fixes, extensions, etc.\r\nmust be made available to the open source community at large when you Deploy in\r\nany form -- either internally or to an outside party. Once you start running\r\nthe software you have to start sharing the software.\r\n\r\nFurther, under the RPL all components you author including schemas, scripts,\r\nsource code, etc. -- regardless of whether they're compiled into a single\r\nbinary or used as two halves of client\/server application -- must be shared.\r\nYou have to share the whole pie, not an isolated slice of it.\r\n\r\nIn addition to these goals, the RPL was authored to meet the requirements of\r\nthe Open Source Definition as maintained by the Open Source Initiative (OSI).\r\n\r\nThe specific terms and conditions of the license are defined in the remainder\r\nof this document.\r\n\r\nLICENSE TERMS\r\n\r\n1.0 General; Applicability & Definitions.

Upon termination of the Agreement, the Licensee shall either destroy all licensed copies of Software Development Kit, and all backups, or return them to Licensor. This obligation shall survive the termination of this Agreement.\r\n\r\n7.

Indemnification\r\n\r\n8.1 Licensee shall indemnify and defend against any and all claims, including claims by third parties or employees of Licensee, which arise directly or indirectly out of Licensee's use or operation of the Software Development Kit or Redistributable Software.\r\n\r\n8.2 The Licensor shall indemnify and hold the Licensee harmless from loss, damage, or liability for direct infringement of any United States, Canadian, or European Union member state patent or copyright with respect to the Software Development Kit or Redistributable Software, provided that the Software Development Kit or Redistributable Software have not been modified and provided the Licensor is promptly notified by the Licensee in writing of any infringement and is permitted to defend, compromise or settle such suit or claim, and provided the Licensee gives to the Licensor such available information, assistance and authority as the Licensor deems necessary to the defense of such suit or claim. Should the use of the Software Development Kit or Redistributable Software be enjoined, or in the event that the Licensor desires to minimize its liabilities hereunder, the Licensor shall have the right, at its sole option and expense to:\r\n\r\n8.2.1 Procure for the Licensee the right to continue the use of the Software Development Kit or Redistributable Software; or,\r\n\r\n8.2.2 Replace the Software Development Kit or Redistributable Software with a non-infringing product; or,\r\n\r\n8.2.3 Modify the Software Development Kit or Redistributable Software so that it becomes non-infringing; or,\r\n\r\n8.2.4 Refund to the Licensee the purchase price paid, if any, by the Licensee for the Software Development Kit.\r\n\r\nDISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY\r\n\r\nTHIS SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT KIT IS SOLD \"AS IS\" AND WITHOUT WARRANTIES AS TO PERFORMANCE OR MERCHANTABILITY.\r\n\r\nTHIS SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT KIT IS SOLD WITHOUT ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES WHATSOEVER.

(\"Licensor\"). Any Jabber Product licensed pursuant to this License is a Licensed Product. Licensed Product, in its entirety, is protected by U.S. copyright law. This License identifies the terms under which you may use, copy, distribute or modify Licensed Product.\r\n\r\nPreamble\r\n\r\nThis Preamble is intended to describe, in plain English, the nature and scope of this License. However, this Preamble is not a part of this license. The legal effect of this License is dependent only upon the terms of the License and not this Preamble.\r\n\r\nThis License complies with the Open Source Definition and has been approved by Open Source Initiative. Software distributed under this License may be marked as \"OSI Certified Open Source Software.\"\r\n\r\nThis License provides that:\r\n\r\n1.      You may use, sell or give away the Licensed Product, alone or as a component of an aggregate software distribution containing programs from several different sources. No royalty or other fee is required.\r\n\r\n2.      Both Source Code and executable versions of the Licensed Product, including Modifications made by previous Contributors, are available for your use. (The terms \"Licensed Product,\" \"Modifications,\" \"Contributors\" and \"Source Code\" are defined in the License.)\r\n\r\n3.      You are allowed to make Modifications to the Licensed Product, and you can create Derivative Works from it. (The term \"Derivative Works\" is defined in the License.)\r\n\r\n4.      By accepting the Licensed Product under the provisions of this License, you agree that any Modifications you make to the Licensed Product and then distribute are governed by the provisions of this License. In particular, you must make the Source Code of your Modifications available to others.\r\n\r\n5.      You may use the Licensed Product for any purpose, but the Licensor is not providing you any warranty whatsoever, nor is the Licensor accepting any liability in the event that the Licensed Product doesn't work properly or causes you any injury or damages.\r\n\r\n6.      If you sublicense the Licensed Product or Derivative Works, you may charge fees for warranty or support, or for accepting indemnity or liability obligations to your customers. You cannot charge for the Source Code.\r\n\r\n7.      If you assert any patent claims against the Licensor relating to the Licensed Product, or if you breach any terms of the License, your rights to the Licensed Product under this License automatically terminate.\r\n\r\nYou may use this License to distribute your own Derivative Works, in which case the provisions of this License will apply to your Derivative Works just as they do to the original Licensed Product.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, you may distribute your Derivative Works under any other OSI-approved Open Source license, or under a proprietary license of your choice. If you use any license other than this License, however, you must continue to fulfill the requirements of this License (including the provisions relating to publishing the Source Code) for those portions of your Derivative Works that consist of the Licensed Product, including the files containing Modifications.\r\n\r\nNew versions of this License may be published from time to time. You may choose to continue to use the license terms in this version of the License or those from the new version. However, only the Licensor has the right to change the License terms as they apply to the Licensed Product.\r\n\r\nThis License relies on precise definitions for certain terms. Those terms are defined when they are first used, and the definitions are repeated for your convenience in a Glossary at the end of the License.\r\n\r\nLicense Terms\r\n\r\n1.      Grant of License From Licensor. Licensor hereby grants you a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive license, subject to third party intellectual property claims, to do the following:\r\n\r\na.       Use, reproduce, modify, display, perform, sublicense and distribute any Modifications created by such Contributor or portions thereof, in both Source Code or as an executable program, either on an unmodified basis or as part of Derivative Works.\r\n\r\nb.       Under claims of patents now or hereafter owned or controlled by Contributor, to make, use, sell, offer for sale, have made, and\/or otherwise dispose of Modifications or portions thereof, but solely to the extent that any such claim is necessary to enable you to make, use, sell, offer for sale, have made, and\/or otherwise dispose of Modifications or portions thereof or Derivative Works thereof.\r\n\r\n2. Grant of License to Modifications From Contributor. \"Modifications\" means any additions to or deletions from the substance or structure of (i) a file containing Licensed Product, or (ii) any new file that contains any part of Licensed Product. Hereinafter in this License, the term \"Licensed Product\" shall include all previous Modifications that you receive from any Contributor. By application of the provisions in Section 4(a) below, each person or entity who created or contributed to the creation of, and distributed, a Modification (a \"Contributor\") hereby grants you a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive license, subject to third party intellectual property claims, to do the following:\r\nUse, reproduce, modify, display, perform, sublicense and distribute any Modifications created by such Contributor or portions thereof, in both Source Code or as an executable program, either on an unmodified basis or as part of Derivative Works.\r\nUnder claims of patents now or hereafter owned or controlled by Contributor, to make, use, sell, offer for sale, have made, and\/or otherwise dispose of Modifications or portions thereof, but solely to the extent that any such claim is necessary to enable you to make, use, sell, offer for sale, have made, and\/or otherwise dispose of Modifications or portions thereof or Derivative Works thereof.\r\n3.      Exclusions From License Grant. Nothing in this License shall be deemed to grant any rights to trademarks, copyrights, patents, trade secrets or any other intellectual property of Licensor or any Contributor except as expressly stated herein.No patent license is granted separate from the Licensed Product, for code that you delete from the Licensed Product, or for combinations of the Licensed Product with other software or hardware. No right is granted to the trademarks of Licensor or any Contributor even if such marks are included in the Licensed Product. Nothing in this License shall be interpreted to prohibit Licensor from licensing under different terms from this License any code that Licensor otherwise would have a right to license.\r\n\r\n4.      Your Obligations Regarding Distribution.\r\n\r\na.       Application of This License to Your Modifications.As an express condition for your use of the Licensed Product, you hereby agree that any Modifications that you create or to which you contribute, and which you distribute, are governed by the terms of this License including, without limitation, Section 2. Any Modifications that you create or to which you contribute may be distributed only under the terms of this License or a future version of this License released under Section 7. You must include a copy of this License with every copy of the Modifications you distribute. You agree not to offer or impose any terms on any Source Code or executable version of the Licensed Product or Modifications that alter or restrict the applicable version of this License or the recipients' rights hereunder.However, you may include an additional document offering the additional rights described in Section 4(e).\r\n\r\nb.       Availability of Source Code. You must make available, under the terms of this License, the Source Code of the Licensed Product and any Modifications that you distribute, either on the same media as you distribute any executable or other form of the Licensed Product, or via a mechanism generally accepted in the software development community for the electronic transfer of data (an \"Electronic Distribution Mechanism\"). The Source Code for any version of Licensed Product or Modifications that you distribute must remain available for at least twelve (12) months after the date it initially became available, or at least six (6) months after a subsequent version of said Licensed Product or Modifications has been made available. You are responsible for ensuring that the Source Code version remains available even if the Electronic Distribution Mechanism is maintained by a third party.\r\n\r\nc.       Description of Modifications. You must cause any Modifications that you create or to which you contribute, and which you distribute, to contain a file documenting the additions, changes or deletions you made to create or contribute to those Modifications, and the dates of any such additions, changes or deletions. You must include a prominent statement that the Modifications are derived, directly or indirectly, from the Licensed Product and include the names of the Licensor and any Contributor to the Licensed Product in (i) the Source Code and (ii) in any notice displayed by a version of the Licensed Product you distribute or in related documentation in which you describe the origin or ownership of the Licensed Product.You may not modify or delete any preexisting copyright notices in the Licensed Product.\r\n\r\nd.       Intellectual Property Matters.\r\n\r\n                                   i.            Third Party Claims. If you have knowledge that a license to a third party's intellectual property right is required to exercise the rights granted by this License, you must include a text file with the Source Code distribution titled \"LEGAL\" that describes the claim and the party making the claim in sufficient detail that a recipient will know whom to contact. If you obtain such knowledge after you make any Modifications available as described in Section 4(b), you shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies you make available thereafter and shall take other steps (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably calculated to inform those who received the Licensed Product from you that new knowledge has been obtained.\r\n\r\n                               ii.            Contributor APIs. If your Modifications include an application programming interface (\"API\") and you have knowledge of patent licenses that are reasonably necessary to implement that API, you must also include this information in the LEGAL file.\r\n\r\n                              iii.            Representations. You represent that, except as disclosed pursuant to 4(d)(i) above, you believe that any Modifications you distribute are your original creations and that you have sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by this License.\r\n\r\ne.       Required Notices. You must duplicate this License in any documentation you provide along with the Source Code of any Modifications you create or to which you contribute, and which you distribute, wherever you describe recipients' rights relating to Licensed Product. You must duplicate the notice contained in Exhibit A (the \"Notice\") in each file of the Source Code of any copy you distribute of the Licensed Product.If you created a Modification, you may add your name as a Contributor to the Notice. If it is not possible to put the Notice in a particular Source Code file due to its structure, then you must include such Notice in a location (such as a relevant directory file) where a user would be likely to look for such a notice. You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Licensed Product.However, you may do so only on your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Licensor or any Contributor. You must make it clear that any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by you alone, and you hereby agree to indemnify the Licensor and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Licensor or such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms you offer.\r\n\r\nf.        Distribution of Executable Versions. You may distribute Licensed Product as an executable program under a license of your choice that may contain terms different from this License provided (i) you have satisfied the requirements of Sections 4(a) through 4(e) for that distribution, (ii) you include a conspicuous notice in the executable version, related documentation and collateral materials stating that the Source Code version of the Licensed Product is available under the terms of this License, including a description of how and where you have fulfilled the obligations of Section 4(b), (iii) you retain all existing copyright notices in the Licensed Product, and (iv) you make it clear that any terms that differ from this License are offered by you alone, not by Licensor or any Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the Licensor and every Contributor for any liability incurred by Licensor or such Contributor as a result of any terms you offer.\r\n\r\ng.       Distribution of Derivative Works. You may create Derivative Works (e.g., combinations of some or all of the Licensed Product with other code) and distribute the Derivative Works as products under any other license you select, with the proviso that the requirements of this License are fulfilled for those portions of the Derivative Works that consist of the Licensed Product or any Modifications thereto.\r\n\r\n5.      Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.If it is impossible for you to comply with any of the terms of this License with respect to some or all of the Licensed Product due to statute, judicial order, or regulation, then you must (i) comply with the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible, (ii) cite the statute or regulation that prohibits you from adhering to the License, and (iii) describe the limitations and the code they affect.Such description must be included in the LEGAL file described in Section 4(d), and must be included with all distributions of the Source Code. Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill at computer programming to be able to understand it.\r\n\r\n6.      Application of This License. This License applies to code to which Licensor or Contributor has attached the Notice in Exhibit A, which is incorporated herein by this reference.\r\n\r\n7.      Versions of This License.\r\n\r\na.       New Versions. Licensor may publish from time to time revised and\/or new versions of the License.\r\n\r\nb.       Effect of New Versions. Once Licensed Product has been published under a particular version of the License, you may always continue to use it under the terms of that version. You may also choose to use such Licensed Product under the terms of any subsequent version of the License published by Licensor. No one other than Licensor has the right to modify the terms applicable to Licensed Product created under this License.\r\n\r\nc.       Derivative Works of this License. If you create or use a modified version of this License, which you may do only in order to apply it to software that is not already a Licensed Product under this License, you must rename your license so that it is not confusingly similar to this License, and must make it clear that your license contains terms that differ from this License. In so naming your license, you may not use any trademark of Licensor or any Contributor.\r\n\r\n8.      Disclaimer of Warranty. LICENSED PRODUCT IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN AS IS BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE LICENSED PRODUCT IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING.THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE LICENSED PRODUCT IS WITH YOU. SHOULD LICENSED PRODUCT PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (AND NOT THE LICENSOR OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE.NO USE OF LICENSED PRODUCT IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.\r\n\r\n9.      Termination.\r\n\r\na.       Automatic Termination Upon Breach. This license and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically if you fail to comply with the terms herein and fail to cure such breach within thirty (30) days of becoming aware of the breach. All sublicenses to the Licensed Product that are properly granted shall survive any termination of this license. Provisions that, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License, shall survive.\r\n\r\nb.       Termination Upon Assertion of Patent Infringement.If you initiate litigation by asserting a patent infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions) against Licensor or a Contributor (Licensor or Contributor against whom you file such an action is referred to herein as Respondent) alleging that Licensed Product directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted by such Respondent to you under Sections 1 or 2 of this License shall terminate prospectively upon sixty (60) days notice from Respondent (the \"Notice Period\") unless within that Notice Period you either agree in writing (i) to pay Respondent a mutually agreeable reasonably royalty for your past or future use of Licensed Product made by such Respondent, or (ii) withdraw your litigation claim with respect to Licensed Product against such Respondent. If within said Notice Period a reasonable royalty and payment arrangement are not mutually agreed upon in writing by the parties or the litigation claim is not withdrawn, the rights granted by Licensor to you under Sections 1 and 2 automatically terminate at the expiration of said Notice Period.\r\n\r\nc.       Reasonable Value of This License. If you assert a patent infringement claim against Respondent alleging that Licensed Product directly or indirectly infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as by license or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses granted by said Respondent under Sections 1 and 2 shall be taken into account in determining the amount or value of any payment or license.\r\n\r\nd.       No Retroactive Effect of Termination. In the event of termination under Sections 9(a) or 9(b) above, all end user license agreements (excluding licenses to distributors and resellers) that have been validly granted by you or any distributor hereunder prior to termination shall survive termination.\r\n\r\n10.  Limitation of Liability. UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL THE LICENSOR, ANY CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF LICENSED PRODUCT, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTYS NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\r\n\r\n11.  Responsibility for Claims. As between Licensor and Contributors, each party is responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly, out of its utilization of rights under this License. You agree to work with Licensor and Contributors to distribute such responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing herein is intended or shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability.\r\n\r\n12.  U.S. Government End Users. The Licensed Product is a commercial item, as that term is defined in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of commercial computer software and commercial computer software documentation, as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users acquire Licensed Product with only those rights set forth herein.\r\n\r\n13.  Miscellaneous. This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be governed by California law provisions (except to the extent applicable law, if any, provides otherwise), excluding its conflict-of-law provisions. You expressly agree that any litigation relating to this license shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Courts of the Northern District of California or the Superior Court of the County of Santa Clara, California (as appropriate), with venue lying in Santa Clara County, California, with the losing party responsible for costs including, without limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys fees and expenses. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. You and Licensor expressly waive any rights to a jury trial in any litigation concerning Licensed Product or this License. Any law or regulation that provides that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not apply to this License.\r\n\r\n14.  Definition of You in This License.You throughout this License, whether in upper or lower case, means an individual or a legal entity exercising rights under, and complying with all of the terms of, this License or a future version of this License issued under Section 7. For legal entities, you includes any entity that controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with you. For purposes of this definition, control means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.\r\n\r\n15.

This license may be particularly suitable if your\r\nprogram is TeX-related (such as a LaTeX package), but you may use it\r\neven if your program is unrelated to TeX.  The section `WHETHER AND HOW\r\nTO DISTRIBUTE PROGRAMS UNDER THIS LICENSE', below, gives instructions,\r\nexamples, and recommendations for authors who are considering\r\ndistributing their programs under this license.\r\n\r\nIn this license document, `The Program' refers to any program\r\ndistributed under this license.\r\n\r\nThis license gives conditions under which The Program may be distributed\r\nand conditions under which modified versions of The Program may be\r\ndistributed.  Individual files of The Program may bear supplementary\r\nand\/or superseding conditions on modification of themselves and on the\r\ndistribution of modified versions of themselves, but *no* file of The\r\nProgram may bear supplementary or superseding conditions on the\r\ndistribution of an unmodified copy of the file.  A distributor wishing\r\nto distribute a complete, unmodified copy of The Program therefore\r\nneeds to check the conditions only in this license and nowhere else.\r\n\r\nActivities other than distribution and\/or modification of The Program\r\nare not covered by this license; they are outside its scope.  In\r\nparticular, the act of running The Program is not restricted.\r\n\r\nWe, the LaTeX3 Project, believe that the conditions below give you\r\nthe freedom to make and distribute modified versions of The Program\r\nthat conform with whatever technical specifications you wish while\r\nmaintaining the availability, integrity, and reliability of\r\nThe Program.  If you do not see how to achieve your goal while \r\nmeeting these conditions, then read the document `cfgguide.tex'\r\nin the base LaTeX distribution for suggestions.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONDITIONS ON DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\r\n===========================================\r\n\r\nYou may distribute a complete, unmodified copy of The Program.\r\nDistribution of only part of The Program is not allowed.\r\n\r\nYou may not modify in any way a file of The Program that bears a legal\r\nnotice forbidding modification of that file.\r\n\r\nYou may distribute a modified file of The Program if, and only if, the\r\nfollowing eight conditions are met:\r\n\r\n  1. You must meet any additional conditions borne by the file on the\r\n     distribution of a modified version of the file as described below\r\n     in the subsection `Additional Conditions on Individual Files of\r\n     The Program'.\r\n \r\n  2. If the file is a LaTeX software file, then you must meet any\r\n     applicable additional conditions on the distribution of a modified\r\n     version of the file that are described below in the subsection\r\n     `Additional Conditions on LaTeX Software Files'.\r\n \r\n  3. You must not distribute the modified file with the filename of the\r\n     original file.\r\n \r\n  4. In the modified file, you must acknowledge the authorship and\r\n     name of the original file, and the name (if any) of the program\r\n     which contains it.\r\n \r\n  5. You must change any identification string in the file to indicate\r\n     clearly that the modified file is not part of The Program.\r\n \r\n  6. You must change any addresses in the modified file for the\r\n     reporting of errors in the file or in The Program generally to\r\n     ensure that reports for files no longer maintained by the original\r\n     maintainers will be directed to the maintainers of the modified\r\n     files.\r\n \r\n  7. You must distribute the modified file under a license that forbids\r\n     distribution both of the modified file and of any files derived\r\n     from the modified file with the filename of the original file.\r\n \r\n  8. You must do either (A) or (B):\r\n\r\n       (A) distribute a copy of The Program (that is, a complete,\r\n           unmodified copy of The Program) together with the modified\r\n           file; if your distribution of the modified file is made by\r\n           offering access to copy the modified file from a designated\r\n           place, then offering equivalent access to copy The Program\r\n           from the same place meets this condition, even though third\r\n           parties are not compelled to copy The Program along with the\r\n           modified file;\r\n\r\n       (B) provide to those who receive the modified file information\r\n           that is sufficient for them to obtain a copy of The Program;\r\n           for example, you may provide a Uniform Resource Locator (URL)\r\n           for a site that you expect will provide them with a copy of \r\n           The Program free of charge (either the version from which\r\n           your modification is derived, or perhaps a later version).\r\n\r\nNote that in the above, `distribution' of a file means making the\r\nfile available to others by any means.  This includes, for instance,\r\ninstalling the file on any machine in such a way that the file is\r\naccessible by users other than yourself.  `Modification' of a file\r\nmeans any procedure that produces a derivative file under any\r\napplicable law -- that is, a file containing the original file or\r\na significant portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications\r\nand\/or translated into another language.\r\n\r\nChanging the name of a file (other than as necessitated by the file\r\nconventions of the target file systems) is considered to be a\r\nmodification of the file.\r\n\r\nThe distribution conditions in this license do not have to be\r\napplied to files that have been modified in accordance with the\r\nabove conditions.  Note, however, that Condition 7. does apply to\r\nany such modified file.\r\n\r\nThe conditions above are not intended to prohibit, and hence do not\r\napply to, the updating, by any method, of a file so that it becomes\r\nidentical to the latest version of that file of The Program.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nA Recommendation on Modification Without Distribution\r\n-----------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nIt is wise never to modify a file of The Program, even for your own\r\npersonal use, without also meeting the above eight conditions for\r\ndistributing the modified file.  While you might intend that such\r\nmodified files will never be distributed, often this will happen by\r\naccident -- you may forget that you have modified the file; or it may\r\nnot occur to you when allowing others to access the modified file\r\nthat you are thus distributing it and violating the conditions of\r\nthis license.  It is usually in your best interest to keep your copy\r\nof The Program identical with the public one.  Many programs provide\r\nways to control the behavior of that program without altering its\r\nlicensed files.\r\n\r\n\r\nAdditional Conditions on Individual Files of The Program\r\n--------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nAn individual file of The Program may bear additional conditions that\r\nsupplement and\/or supersede the conditions in this license if, and only\r\nif, such additional conditions exclusively concern modification of the\r\nfile or distribution of a modified version of the file.  The conditions\r\non individual files of The Program therefore may differ only with\r\nrespect to the kind and extent of modification of those files that\r\nis allowed, and with respect to the distribution of modified versions\r\nof those files.\r\n\r\n\r\nAdditional Conditions on LaTeX Software Files\r\n---------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nIf a file of The Program is intended to be used with LaTeX (that is,\r\nif it is a LaTeX software file), then the following additional\r\nconditions, which supplement and\/or supersede the conditions\r\nabove, apply to the file according to its filename extension:\r\n\r\n  - You may not modify any file with filename extension `.ins' since\r\n    these are installation files containing the legal notices that are\r\n    placed in the files they generate.\r\n \r\n  - You may distribute modified versions of files with filename\r\n    extension `.fd' (LaTeX font definition files) under the standard\r\n    conditions of the LPPL as described above.  You may also distribute\r\n    such modified LaTeX font definition files with their original names\r\n    provided that:\r\n    (1) the only changes to the original files either enable use of\r\n        available fonts or prevent attempts to access unavailable fonts;\r\n    (2) you also distribute the original, unmodified files (TeX input\r\n        paths can be used to control which set of LaTeX font definition\r\n        files is actually used by TeX).\r\n\r\n  - You may distribute modified versions of files with filename\r\n    extension `.cfg' (configuration files) with their original names.\r\n    The Program may (and usually will) specify the range of commands\r\n    that are allowed in a particular configuration file.\r\n \r\nBecause of portability and exchangeability issues in LaTeX software,\r\nThe LaTeX3 Project deprecates the distribution of modified versions of\r\ncomponents of LaTeX or of generally available contributed code for them,\r\nbut such distribution can meet the conditions of this license.\r\n\r\n\r\nNO WARRANTY\r\n===========\r\n\r\nThere is no warranty for The Program.  Except when otherwise stated in\r\nwriting, The Copyright Holder provides The Program `as is', without\r\nwarranty of any kind, either expressed or implied, including, but not\r\nlimited to, the implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for\r\na particular purpose.  The entire risk as to the quality and performance\r\nof The Program is with you.  Should The Program prove defective, you\r\nassume the cost of all necessary servicing, repair, or correction.\r\n\r\nIn no event unless agreed to in writing will The Copyright Holder, or\r\nany author named in the files of The Program, or any other party who may\r\ndistribute and\/or modify The Program as permitted above, be liable to\r\nyou for damages, including any general, special, incidental or\r\nconsequential damages arising out of any use of The Program or out of\r\ninability to use The Program (including, but not limited to, loss of\r\ndata, data being rendered inaccurate, or losses sustained by anyone as\r\na result of any failure of The Program to operate with any other\r\nprograms), even if The Copyright Holder or said author or said other\r\nparty has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHETHER AND HOW TO DISTRIBUTE PROGRAMS UNDER THIS LICENSE\r\n=========================================================\r\n\r\nThis section contains important instructions, examples, and\r\nrecommendations for authors who are considering distributing their\r\nprograms under this license.  These authors are addressed as `you' in\r\nthis section.\r\n\r\n\r\nChoosing This License or Another License\r\n----------------------------------------\r\n\r\nIf for any part of your program you want or need to use *distribution*\r\nconditions that differ from those in this license, then do not refer to\r\nthis license anywhere in your program but instead distribute your\r\nprogram under a different license.  You may use the text of this license\r\nas a model for your own license, but your license should not refer to\r\nthe LPPL or otherwise give the impression that your program is\r\ndistributed under the LPPL.\r\n\r\nThe document `modguide.tex' in the base LaTeX distribution explains\r\nthe motivation behind the conditions of this license.  It explains,\r\nfor example, why distributing LaTeX under the GNU General Public\r\nLicense (GPL) was considered inappropriate.  Even if your program is\r\nunrelated to LaTeX, the discussion in `modguide.tex' may still be\r\nrelevant, and authors intending to distribute their programs under any\r\nlicense are encouraged to read it.\r\n\r\n\r\nHow to Use This License\r\n-----------------------\r\n\r\nTo use this license, place in each of the files of your program both\r\nan explicit copyright notice including your name and the year and also\r\na statement that the distribution and\/or modification of the file is\r\nconstrained by the conditions in this license.\r\n\r\nHere is an example of such a notice and statement:\r\n\r\n  %% pig.dtx\r\n  %% Copyright 2001 M. Y. Name\r\n  %\r\n  % This program may be distributed and\/or modified under the\r\n  % conditions of the LaTeX Project Public License, either version 1.2\r\n  % of this license or (at your option) any later version.\r\n  % The latest version of this license is in\r\n  %   http:\/\/www.latex-project.org\/lppl.txt\r\n  % and version 1.2 or later is part of all distributions of LaTeX \r\n  % version 1999\/12\/01 or later.\r\n  %\r\n  % This program consists of the files pig.dtx and pig.ins\r\n\r\nGiven such a notice and statement in a file, the conditions given in\r\nthis license document would apply, with `The Program' referring to the\r\ntwo files `pig.dtx' and `pig.ins', and `The Copyright Holder' referring\r\nto the person `M. Y. Name'.\r\n\r\n\r\nImportant Recommendations\r\n-------------------------\r\n\r\n Defining What Constitutes The Program\r\n\r\n   The LPPL requires that distributions of The Program contain all the\r\n   files of The Program.  It is therefore important that you provide a\r\n   way for the licensee to determine which files constitute The Program.\r\n   This could, for example, be achieved by explicitly listing all the\r\n   files of The Program near the copyright notice of each file or by\r\n   using a line like\r\n\r\n    % This program consists of all files listed in manifest.txt.\r\n\r\n   in that place.  In the absence of an unequivocal list it might be\r\n   impossible for the licensee to determine what is considered by you\r\n   to comprise The Program.\r\n\r\n Noting Exceptional Files\r\n  \r\n   If The Program contains any files bearing additional conditions on\r\n   modification, or on distribution of modified versions, of those\r\n   files (other than those listed in `Additional Conditions on LaTeX\r\n   Software Files'), then it is recommended that The Program contain a\r\n   prominent file that defines the exceptional conditions, and either\r\n   lists the exceptional files or defines one or more categories of\r\n   exceptional files.\r\n\r\n   Files containing the text of a license (such as this file) are\r\n   often examples of files bearing more restrictive conditions on\r\n   modification.  LaTeX configuration files (with filename extension\r\n   `.cfg') are examples of files bearing less restrictive conditions\r\n   on the distribution of a modified version of the file.  The\r\n   additional conditions on LaTeX software given above are examples \r\n   of declaring a category of files bearing exceptional additional\r\n   conditions.\r\n\r\n",

Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party patent license is required to allow Recipient to distribute the Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license before distributing the Program.\r\n \r\nEach Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright license set forth in this Agreement.\r\n \r\n \r\n3. REQUIREMENTS\r\nA Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form under its own license agreement, provided that:\r\nit complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement and The Open Group Agreement; and\r\n \r\nits license agreement:\r\n \r\n \r\neffectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties and conditions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose;\r\neffectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits;\r\nstates that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are offered by that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and\r\nstates that source code for the Program is available from such Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily used for software exchange.\r\n \r\nWhen the Program is made available in source code form:\r\nit must be made available under this Agreement and the Open Group Agreement; and\r\n \r\na copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the Program.\r\n \r\n \r\nEach Contributor must include the following in a conspicuous location in the Program:\r\nCopyright (C) May, 2000 The Open Group, Metro Link, Incorporated and others. All Rights Reserved\r\n \r\nIn addition, each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its Contribution, if any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent Recipients to identify the originator of the Contribution.\r\n4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION\r\nCommercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner which does not create potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering, such Contributor (\"Commercial Contributor\") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every other Contributor (\"Indemnified Contributor\") against any losses, damages and costs (collectively \"Losses\") arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program in a commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must:\r\n \r\na)       promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in writing of such claim, and\r\n \r\nb)       allow the Commercial Contributor to control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any related settlement negotiations.\r\n \r\nThe Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such claim at its own expense.\r\nFor example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims against the other Contributors related to those performance claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay those damages.\r\n5. NO WARRANTY\r\nEXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN \"AS IS\" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement, including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.\r\n6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY\r\nEXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\r\n7. GENERAL\r\nIf any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.\r\n \r\nIf Recipient institutes patent litigation against a Contributor with respect to a patent applicable to software (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit), then any patent licenses granted by that Contributor to such Recipient under this Agreement shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed. In addition, if Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software or hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.\r\n \r\nAll Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable. However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement and any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and survive.\r\n \r\nMETRO LINK may publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement from time to time. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing version number. The Program (including Contributions) may always be distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which it was received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is published, Contributor may elect to distribute the Program (including its Contributions) under the new version. No one other than METRO LINK has the right to modify this Agreement. Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual property of any Contributor under this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved.\r\n \r\nThis Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of Florida and the intellectual property laws of the United States of America.\r\n \r\nNo party to this Agreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement more than one year after the cause of action arose. Each party waives its rights to a jury trial in any resulting litigation.",

(\"Licensor\"). Any Motosoto\r\nProduct licensed pursuant to this License is a \"Licensed Product.\" Licensed\r\nProduct, in its entirety, is protected by Dutch copyright law.\r\nThis\r\nLicense identifies the terms under which you may use, copy, distribute or modify\r\nLicensed Product and has been submitted to the Open Software Initiative (OSI)\r\nfor approval.\r\n\r\nPreamble\r\n\r\nThis Preamble is intended to describe, in plain English, the nature and scope of\r\nthis License. However, this Preamble is not a part of this license. The legal\r\neffect of this License is dependent only upon the terms of the License and not\r\nthis Preamble.\r\nThis License complies with the Open Source Definition and has been approved by\r\nOpen Source Initiative. Software distributed under this License may be marked\r\nas \"OSI Certified Open Source Software.\"\r\n\r\nThis License provides that:\r\n\r\n1. You may use, sell or give away the Licensed Product, alone or as a\r\ncomponent of an aggregate software distribution containing\r\nprograms from several different sources. No royalty or other fee is\r\nrequired.\r\n\r\n2. Both Source Code and executable versions of the Licensed Product,\r\nincluding Modifications made by previous Contributors, are\r\navailable for your use. (The terms \"Licensed Product,\" \"Modifications,\"\r\n\"Contributors\" and \"Source Code\" are defined in the License.)\r\n\r\n3. You are allowed to make Modifications to the Licensed Product, and you\r\ncan create Derivative Works from it. (The term \"Derivative\r\nWorks\" is defined in the License.)\r\n\r\n4. By accepting the Licensed Product under the provisions of this License,\r\nyou agree that any Modifications you make to the Licensed\r\nProduct and then distribute are governed by the provisions of this\r\nLicense. In particular, you must make the Source Code of your\r\nModifications available to others.\r\n\r\n5. You may use the Licensed Product for any purpose, but the Licensor is\r\nnot providing you any warranty whatsoever, nor is the Licensor\r\naccepting any liability in the event that the Licensed Product doesn't\r\nwork properly or causes you any injury or damages.\r\n\r\n6. If you sublicense the Licensed Product or Derivative Works, you may\r\ncharge fees for warranty or support, or for accepting indemnity\r\nor liability obligations to your customers. You cannot charge for the\r\nSource Code.\r\n\r\n7. If you assert any patent claims against the Licensor relating to the\r\nLicensed Product, or if you breach any terms of the License, your\r\nrights to the Licensed Product under this License automatically\r\nterminate.\r\n\r\nYou may use this License to distribute your own Derivative Works, in which\r\ncase the provisions of this License will apply to your Derivative\r\nWorks just as they do to the original Licensed Product.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, you may distribute your Derivative Works under any other\r\nOSI-approved Open Source license, or under a proprietary license of\r\nyour choice. If you use any license other than this License, however, you must\r\ncontinue to fulfill the requirements of this License (including the\r\nprovisions relating to publishing the Source Code) for those portions of your\r\nDerivative Works that consist of the Licensed Product, including\r\nthe files containing Modifications.\r\n\r\nNew versions of this License may be published from time to time. You may\r\nchoose to continue to use the license terms in this version of the\r\nLicense or those from the new version. However, only the Licensor has the right\r\nto change the License terms as they apply to the Licensed\r\nProduct.\r\nThis License relies on precise definitions for certain terms. Those terms are\r\ndefined when they are first used, and the definitions are repeated for\r\nyour convenience in a Glossary at the end of the License.\r\n\r\nLicense Terms\r\n\r\n1. Grant of License From Licensor.\r\n\r\nLicensor\r\nhereby grants you a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive license, subject to\r\nthird\r\nparty intellectual property claims, to do the following:\r\n\r\na. Use, reproduce, modify, display, perform, sublicense and\r\ndistribute Licensed Product or portions thereof (including\r\nModifications as hereinafter defined), in both Source Code or as\r\nan executable program. \"Source Code\" means the preferred\r\nform for making modifications to the Licensed Product, including\r\nall modules contained therein, plus any associated\r\ninterface definition files, scripts used to control compilation\r\nand installation of an executable program, or a list of\r\ndifferential comparisons against the Source Code of the Licensed\r\nProduct.\r\n\r\nb. Create Derivative Works (as that term is defined under Dutch\r\ncopyright law) of Licensed Product by adding to or deleting\r\nfrom the substance or structure of said Licensed Product.\r\n\r\nc. Under claims of patents now or hereafter owned or controlled\r\nby Licensor, to make, use, sell, offer for sale, have made,\r\nand\/or otherwise dispose of Licensed Product or portions thereof,\r\nbut solely to the extent that any such claim is necessary to\r\nenable you to make, use, sell, offer for sale, have made, and\/or\r\notherwise dispose of Licensed Product or portions thereof or\r\nDerivative Works thereof.\r\n\r\n2. Grant of License to Modifications From\r\nContributor.\r\n\r\n\"Modifications\" means any additions to or\r\ndeletions from the substance or\r\nstructure of (i) a file containing Licensed Product, or (ii) any new file\r\nthat contains any part of Licensed Product. Hereinafter in this\r\nLicense, the term \"Licensed Product\" shall include all previous\r\nModifications that you receive from any Contributor. By\r\napplication of the provisions in Section 4(a) below, each person or\r\nentity who created or contributed to the creation of, and distributed,\r\na Modification (a \"Contributor\") hereby grants you a world-wide,\r\nroyalty-free, non-exclusive license, subject to third party\r\nintellectual property claims, to do the following:\r\n\r\na. Use, reproduce, modify, display, perform, sublicense and\r\ndistribute any Modifications created by such Contributor or\r\nportions thereof, in both Source Code or as an executable program,\r\neither on an unmodified basis or as part of Derivative\r\nWorks.\r\n\r\nb. Under claims of patents now or hereafter owned or controlled by\r\nContributor, to make, use, sell, offer for sale, have made,\r\nand\/or otherwise dispose of Modifications or portions thereof, but\r\nsolely to the extent that any such claim is necessary to\r\nenable you to make, use, sell, offer for sale, have made, and\/or\r\notherwise dispose of Modifications or portions thereof or\r\nDerivative Works thereof.\r\n\r\n3. Exclusions From License Grant.\r\n\r\nNothing in\r\nthis License shall be deemed to grant any rights to trademarks, copyrights,\r\npatents,\r\ntrade secrets or any other intellectual property of Licensor or any\r\nContributor except as expressly stated herein. No patent license is\r\ngranted separate from the Licensed Product, for code that you delete from\r\nthe Licensed Product, or for combinations of the Licensed\r\nProduct with other software or hardware. No right is granted to the\r\ntrademarks of Licensor or any Contributor even if such marks are\r\nincluded in the Licensed Product. Nothing in this License shall be\r\ninterpreted to prohibit Licensor from licensing under different\r\nterms from this License any code that Licensor otherwise would have a\r\nright to license.\r\n\r\n4. Your Obligations Regarding Distribution.\r\n\r\na. Application of This License to Your\r\nModifications. As an express condition for your use of the Licensed\r\nProduct, you\r\nhereby agree that any Modifications that you create or to which\r\nyou contribute, and which you distribute, are governed by the\r\nterms of this License including, without limitation, Section 2.\r\nAny Modifications that you create or to which you contribute\r\nmay be distributed only under the terms of this License or a\r\nfuture version of this License released under Section 7. You must\r\ninclude a copy of this License with every copy of the\r\nModifications you distribute. You agree not to offer or impose any\r\nterms on any Source Code or executable version of the Licensed\r\nProduct or Modifications that alter or restrict the applicable\r\nversion of this License or the recipients' rights hereunder.\r\nHowever, you may include an additional document offering the\r\nadditional rights described in Section 4(e).\r\n\r\nb. Availability of Source Code. You must make\r\navailable, under the terms of this License, the Source Code of the Licensed\r\nProduct and any Modifications that you distribute, either on the\r\nsame media as you distribute any executable or other form\r\nof the Licensed Product, or via a mechanism generally accepted in\r\nthe software development community for the electronic\r\ntransfer of data (an \"Electronic Distribution Mechanism\"). The\r\nSource Code for any version of Licensed Product or\r\nModifications that you distribute must remain available for at\r\nleast twelve (12) months after the date it initially became\r\navailable, or at least six (6) months after a subsequent version\r\nof said Licensed Product or Modifications has been made\r\navailable. You are responsible for ensuring that the Source Code\r\nversion remains available even if the Electronic Distribution\r\nMechanism is maintained by a third party.\r\n\r\nc. Description of Modifications. You must cause any\r\nModifications that you create or to which you contribute, and which\r\nyou distribute, to contain a file documenting the additions,\r\nchanges or deletions you made to create or contribute to those\r\nModifications, and the dates of any such additions, changes or\r\ndeletions. You must include a prominent statement that the\r\nModifications are derived, directly or indirectly, from the\r\nLicensed Product and include the names of the Licensor and any\r\nContributor to the Licensed Product in (i) the Source Code and\r\n(ii) in any notice displayed by a version of the Licensed\r\nProduct you distribute or in related documentation in which you\r\ndescribe the origin or ownership of the Licensed Product.\r\nYou may not modify or delete any preexisting copyright notices in\r\nthe Licensed Product.\r\n\r\nd. Intellectual Property Matters.\r\n\r\ni. Third Party Claims. If you have\r\nknowledge that a license to a third party's intellectual property right is\r\nrequired\r\nto exercise the rights granted by this License, you must\r\ninclude a text file with the Source Code distribution titled\r\n\"LEGAL\" that describes the claim and the party making the\r\nclaim in sufficient detail that a recipient will know\r\nwhom to contact. If you obtain such knowledge after you make\r\nany Modifications available as described in Section\r\n4(b), you shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies\r\nyou make available thereafter and shall take other\r\nsteps (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or\r\nnewsgroups) reasonably calculated to inform those who\r\nreceived the Licensed Product from you that new knowledge\r\nhas been obtained.\r\n\r\nii. Contributor APIs. If your\r\nModifications include an application programming interface (\"API\") and you have\r\nknowledge of patent licenses that are reasonably necessary\r\nto implement that API, you must also include this\r\ninformation in the LEGAL file.\r\n\r\niii. Representations. You represent that,\r\nexcept as disclosed pursuant to 4(d)(i) above, you believe that any\r\nModifications you distribute are your original creations and\r\nthat you have sufficient rights to grant the rights\r\nconveyed by this License.\r\n\r\ne. Required Notices. You must duplicate this\r\nLicense in any documentation you provide along with the Source Code of any\r\nModifications you create or to which you contribute, and which you\r\ndistribute, wherever you describe recipients' rights\r\nrelating to Licensed Product. You must duplicate the notice\r\ncontained in Exhibit A (the \"Notice\") in each file of the Source\r\nCode of any copy you distribute of the Licensed Product. If you\r\ncreated a Modification, you may add your name as a\r\nContributor to the Notice. If it is not possible to put the Notice\r\nin a particular Source Code file due to its structure, then\r\nyou must include such Notice in a location (such as a relevant\r\ndirectory file) where a user would be likely to look for such a\r\nnotice. You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, warranty,\r\nsupport, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more\r\nrecipients of Licensed Product. However, you may do so only on\r\nyour own behalf, and not on behalf of the Licensor or any\r\nContributor. You must make it clear that any such warranty,\r\nsupport, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by you\r\nalone, and you hereby agree to indemnify the Licensor and every\r\nContributor for any liability incurred by the Licensor or such\r\nContributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or\r\nliability terms you offer.\r\n\r\nf. Distribution of Executable Versions. You may\r\ndistribute Licensed Product as an executable program under a license of\r\nyour choice that may contain terms different from this License\r\nprovided (i) you have satisfied the requirements of Sections\r\n4(a) through 4(e) for that distribution, (ii) you include a\r\nconspicuous notice in the executable version, related documentation\r\nand collateral materials stating that the Source Code version of\r\nthe Licensed Product is available under the terms of this\r\nLicense, including a description of how and where you have\r\nfulfilled the obligations of Section 4(b), (iii) you retain all\r\nexisting copyright notices in the Licensed Product, and (iv) you\r\nmake it clear that any terms that differ from this License are\r\noffered by you alone, not by Licensor or any Contributor. You\r\nhereby agree to indemnify the Licensor and every Contributor\r\nfor any liability incurred by Licensor or such Contributor as a\r\nresult of any terms you offer.\r\n\r\ng. Distribution of Derivative Works. You may\r\ncreate Derivative Works (e.g., combinations of some or all of the Licensed\r\nProduct with other code) and distribute the Derivative Works as\r\nproducts under any other license you select, with the\r\nproviso that the requirements of this License are fulfilled for\r\nthose portions of the Derivative Works that consist of the\r\nLicensed Product or any Modifications thereto.\r\n\r\n5. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or\r\nRegulation.\r\n\r\nIf it is impossible for you to comply with any of\r\nthe terms of this License with\r\nrespect to some or all of the Licensed Product due to statute, judicial\r\norder, or regulation, then you must (i) comply with the terms of\r\nthis License to the maximum extent possible, (ii) cite the statute or\r\nregulation that prohibits you from adhering to the License, and\r\n(iii) describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description\r\nmust be included in the LEGAL file described in Section 4(d),\r\nand must be included with all distributions of the Source Code. Except to\r\nthe extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such\r\ndescription must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary\r\nskill at computer programming to be able to understand it.\r\n\r\n6. Application of This License.\r\n\r\nThis License\r\napplies to code to which Licensor or Contributor has attached the Notice in\r\nExhibit A,\r\nwhich is incorporated herein by this reference.\r\n\r\n7. Versions of This License.\r\n\r\na. Version. The Motosoto Open Source License is\r\nderived from the Jabber Open Source License. All changes are related to\r\napplicable law and the location of court.\r\n\r\nb. New Versions. Licensor may publish from time to\r\ntime revised and\/or new versions of the License.\r\n\r\nc. Effect of New Versions. Once Licensed Product\r\nhas been published under a particular version of the License, you may always\r\ncontinue to use it under the terms of that version. You may also\r\nchoose to use such Licensed Product under the terms of any\r\nsubsequent version of the License published by Licensor. No one\r\nother than Lic ensor has the right to modify the terms\r\napplicable to Licensed Product created under this License.\r\n\r\nd. Derivative Works of this License. If you\r\ncreate or use a modified version of this License, which you may do only in\r\norder to\r\napply it to software that is not already a Licensed Product under\r\nthis License, you must rename your license so that it is not\r\nconfusingly similar to this License, and must make it clear that\r\nyour license contains terms that differ from this License. In\r\nso naming your license, you may not use any trademark of Licensor\r\nor any Contributor.\r\n\r\n8. Disclaimer of Warranty.\r\n\r\nLICENSED PRODUCT IS\r\nPROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN \"AS IS\" BASIS, WITHOUT\r\nWARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT\r\nLIMITATION, WARRANTIES\r\nTHAT THE LICENSED PRODUCT IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A\r\nPARTICULAR PURPOSE OR\r\nNON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE\r\nLICENSED PRODUCT IS\r\nWITH YOU. SHOULD LICENSED PRODUCT PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU\r\n(AND NOT THE LICENSOR OR\r\nANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR\r\nOR CORRECTION. THIS\r\nDISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO\r\nUSE OF LICENSED\r\nPRODUCT IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.\r\n\r\n9. Termination.\r\n\r\na. Automatic Termination Upon Breach. This\r\nlicense and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically if you\r\nfail to comply with the terms herein and fail to cure such breach\r\nwithin thirty (30) days of becoming aware of the breach.\r\nAll sublicenses to the Licensed Product that are properly granted\r\nshall survive any termination of this license. Provisions\r\nthat, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the\r\ntermination of this License, shall survive.\r\n\r\nb. Termination Upon Assertion of Patent\r\nInfringement. If you initiate litigation by asserting a patent\r\ninfringement claim\r\n(excluding declaratory judgment actions) against Licensor or a\r\nContributor (Licensor or Contributor against whom you file\r\nsuch an action is referred to herein as \"Respondent\") alleging\r\nthat Licensed Product directly or indirectly infringes any\r\npatent, then any and all rights granted by such Respondent to you\r\nunder Sections 1 or 2 of this License shall terminate\r\nprospectively upon sixty (60) days notice from Respondent (the\r\n\"Notice Period\") unless within that Notice Period you\r\neither agree in writing (i) to pay Respondent a mutually agreeable\r\nreasonably royalty for your past or future use of Licensed\r\nProduct made by such Respondent, or (ii) withdraw your litigation\r\nclaim with respect to Licensed Product against such\r\nRespondent. If within said Notice Period a reasonable royalty and\r\npayment arrangement are not mutually agreed upon in\r\nwriting by the parties or the litigation claim is not withdrawn,\r\nthe rights granted by Licensor to you under Sections 1 and 2\r\nautomatically terminate at the expiration of said Notice\r\nPeriod.\r\n\r\nc. Reasonable Value of This License. If you assert a\r\npatent infringement claim against Respondent alleging that Licensed\r\nProduct directly or indirectly infringes any patent where such\r\nclaim is resolved (such as by license or settlement) prior to\r\nthe initiation of patent infringement litigation, then the\r\nreasonable value of the licenses granted by said Respondent under\r\nSections 1 and 2 shall be taken into account in determining the\r\namount or value of any payment or license.\r\n\r\nd. No Retroactive Effect of Termination. In the\r\nevent of termination under Sections 9(a) or 9(b) above, all end user license\r\nagreements (excluding licenses to distributors and reselle rs)\r\nthat have been validly granted by you or any distributor\r\nhereunder prior to termination shall survive\r\ntermination.\r\n\r\n10. Limitation of Liability.\r\n\r\nUNDER NO\r\nCIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT\r\n(INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL THE LICENSOR, ANY\r\nCONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY\r\nDISTRIBUTOR OF LICENSED PRODUCT, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES,\r\nBE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON\r\nFOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY\r\nCHARACTER INCLUDING,\r\nWITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER\r\nFAILURE OR\r\nMALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF\r\nSUCH PARTY SHALL\r\nHAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF\r\nLIABILITY SHALL NOT\r\nAPPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH\r\nPARTY",

If Epinions, Inc. makes available to you a logo for downloading, Epinions hereby grants to you a nonexclusive, nonassignable, nonsublicenseable, royalty-free license to display one of the Epinions logos above, including the associated trademark(s) and HTML code (collectively, the \"Logo\") for the sole purpose of (a) linking to the Epinions.com home page, your personal profile page, or your affiliate home page, or (b) if you are a member of the press, including the Logo in an article that references Epinions.  If Epinions makes available to you for downloading HTML code that calls on its servers, Epinions hereby grants to you a nonexclusive, nonassignable, nonsublicenseable, royalty-free license to use the HTML code above (the \"Code\") without modification for the sole purpose of calling on Epinions' servers to include the associated Logo on your site.\r\n\r\n2.  Restrictions. \r\n\r\n2.1  If you are using the license described in Section 1(a), you must use the Logo as an active hypertext link only to a page enumerated there.   You may not frame Epinions.com, cause the link to create a new browser window (unless such window occupies 100% of the user's screen and appears above all other browser windows), or otherwise cause users to display the site in a distorted fashion. \r\n\r\n2.2  You may display the Logo only in the form and at the size provided to you.  You may not modify or alter the Logo or Code in any way, including size, proportions, colors, elements, type or any other respect.  You may not animate, morph or otherwise distort the Logo's perspective or dimensional appearance, nor may you use screen shots of your pages (to the extent that the Logo appears in the screen shot) in any other medium (except as permitted by Section 1(b)).  If Epinions provides you with a substitute version of the Logo, you shall replace the Logo as soon as reasonably possible. \r\n\r\n2.3  The Logo shall be surrounded by a reasonable amount of empty space, and you may not use the Logo in conjunction with other logos or marks in a way that would create a combination mark.  You may not use the Logo in a way that suggests that Epinions endorses or sponsors your site.  The Logo may not appear larger or more prominently than other branding on the page on which it is displayed. \r\n\r\n2.4  You may not use the Logo in any way that tarnishes, blurs or dilutes the quality of Epinions' trademarks or any associated goodwill.  Without limiting the foregoing, you shall not display the Logo on any pages that contain infringing or illegal content. \r\n\r\n2.5  You acknowledge Epinions' sole and exclusive ownership of the Logo and the Code, and you shall not take any action inconsistent with such ownership, such as adopting, using, registering, or attempting to register any logo or trademark confusingly similar to the Logo.  All use of or goodwill associated with the Logo shall inure to Epinions' benefit.  You may not use the Logo or Code in any manner not expressly authorized under this Agreement.\r\n\r\n3.  Termination.  Epinions may terminate this Agreement or the trademark or Code license at any time for any reason or no reason.  You may terminate this Agreement at any time for any reason or no reason.  This Agreement and your license automatically terminates if you breach any provision of this Agreement.  In the event of termination, (a) you shall immediately remove the Logo or Code from your site and otherwise cease using the Logo and Code, and (b) Sections 3-7 shall survive.\r\n\r\n4.  No Warranty.  THE LOGO AND CODE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS.\"  EPINIONS DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR STATUTORY, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.  Some states do not allow the disclaimer of implied warranties, so the foregoing disclaimer may not apply to you.  This warranty gives you specific legal rights and you may also have other legal rights which vary from state to state.\r\n\r\n5.  Liability Limits. EPINIONS DISCLAIMS ALL CONSEQUENTIAL, INCIDENTAL OR SPECIAL DAMAGES OR LOST PROFITS ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT, THE CODE OR THE LOGO (HOWEVER ARISING, INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE).  EPINIONS' TOTAL LIABILITY TO YOU IS LIMITED TO $1,000.  Some states do not allow the foregoing limitations of liability, so they may not apply to you. \r\n\r\n6.  Entire Agreement\/Amendment.  This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement, and supersede the provisions of any other agreements or understandings (oral or written), between the parties with respect to the Logo and Code.  However, this Agreement does not modify in any respect the Epinions Member Agreement or associated documents.  This Agreement may be amended only by a writing physically signed by both Epinions and you.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, Epinions may modify the Agreement in its sole discretion by notifying you by email of any proposed changes, which changes shall be effective upon when a notice is sent to your email address.  If you do not agree with any amendments, you may terminate your license to the Logo or Code.\r\n\r\n7.  General.  This Agreement is governed in all respects by the laws of the State of California as such laws are applied to agreements entered into and to be performed entirely within California between California residents.  Both parties submit to personal jurisdiction in California and further agree that any cause of action arising under this Agreement shall be brought exclusively in a court in San Mateo County, California.  Epinions shall be excused for any failure to perform to the extent that its performance is prevented by any reason outside of its control.  No agency, partnership, joint venture, employment or franchise relationship is intended or created by this Agreement.  If any portion of this Agreement is deemed unenforceable, that portion shall be enforced to the maximum extent possible and the remaining portions of the Agreement shall be given full effect.  Epinions' failure to act in a particular circumstance does not waive the ability to act with respect to that circumstance or similar circumstances.\r\n",

In order to clarify the intellectual property license granted with Contributions from any person or entity, Red Hat, Inc. (\"Red Hat\"), as maintainer of the Project, must have a Contributor License Agreement (CLA) on file that has been signed by each Contributor, indicating agreement to the license terms below. This license is for Your protection as a Contributor as well as the protection of the Project and its users; it does not change your rights to use your own Contributions for any other purpose.\r\n\r\nYou and the Project hereby accept and agree to the following terms and conditions:\r\n\r\n1. Contributors and Contributions.\r\nA. The Project and any individual or legal entity that voluntarily submits to the Project a Contribution are collectively addressed herein as \"Contributors\". For legal entities, the entity making a Contribution and all other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common control with that entity are considered to be a single Contributor. For the purposes of this definition, \"control\" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.\r\nB. A \"Contribution\" is any original work, including any modification or addition to an existing work, that has been submitted for inclusion in, or documentation of, any of the products owned or managed by the Project, where such work originates from that particular Contributor or from some entity acting on behalf of that Contributor.\r\nC. A Contribution is \"submitted\" when any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication is sent to the Project, including but not limited to communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems, and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the Project for the purpose of discussing or improving software or documentation of the Project, but excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise designated in writing by you as \"Not a Contribution.\"\r\nD. Any Contribution submitted by you to the Project shall be under the terms and conditions of this License, without any additional terms or conditions, unless you explicitly state otherwise in the submission.\r\n2. Contributor Grant of License. You hereby grant to Red Hat, Inc., on behalf of the Project, and to recipients of software distributed by the Project:\r\n(a) a perpetual, non-exclusive, worldwide, fully paid-up, royalty free, irrevocable copyright license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute your Contribution and such derivative works; and,\r\n(b) a perpetual, non-exclusive, worldwide, fully paid-up, royalty free, irrevocable (subject to Section 3) patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer your Contribution and derivative works thereof, where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable by you that are necessarily infringed by your Contribution alone or by combination of your Contribution with the work to which you submitted the Contribution. Except for the license granted in this section, you reserve all right, title and interest in and to your Contributions.\r\n3. Reciprocity. As of the date any such litigation is filed, your patent grant shall immediately terminate with respect to any party that institutes patent litigation against you (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that your Contribution, or the work to which you have contributed, constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement.\r\n4. You represent that you are legally entitled to grant the above license. If your employer(s) has rights to intellectual property that you create that includes your Contributions, you represent that you have received permission to make Contributions on behalf of that employer, that your employer has waived such rights for your Contributions to the Project, or that your employer has executed a separate Corporate CLA with the Project.\r\n5. You represent that each of your Contributions is your original creation (see section 7 for submissions on behalf of others). You represent that your Contribution submission(s) include complete details of any third-party license or other restriction (including, but not limited to, related copyright, patents and trademarks) of which you are personally aware and which are associated with any part of your Contribution.\r\n6. You are not expected to provide support for your Contributions, except to the extent you desire to provide support. You may provide support for free, for a fee, or not at all. Your Contributions are provided on an \"AS IS\" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions of NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.\r\n7. Should you wish to submit work that is not your original creation, you may submit it to the Project separately from any Contribution, identifying the complete details of its source and of any license or other restriction (including, but not limited to, related patents, trademarks, and license agreements) of which you are personally aware, and conspicuously marking the work as \"Submitted on behalf of a third-party: [named here] \".\r\n8. You agree to notify the Project of any facts or circumstances of which you become aware that would make these representations inaccurate in any respect.\r\n9.

Their implementation has been reformulated in order to allow everyone to use creations of the human mind in a creative manner, regardless of their types and ways of expression.\r\n\r\nWhile the public's access to creations of the human mind usually is restricted by the implementation of copyright law, it is favoured by the Free Art License. This license intends to allow the use of a work\u2019s resources; to establish new conditions for creating in order to increase creation opportunities. The Free Art License grants the right to use a work, and acknowledges the right holder\u2019s and the user\u2019s rights and responsibility.\r\n\r\nThe invention and development of digital technologies, Internet and Free Software have changed creation methods: creations of the human mind can obviously be distributed, exchanged, and transformed. They allow to produce common works to which everyone can contribute to the benefit of all.\r\n\r\nThe main rationale for this Free Art License is to promote and protect these creations of the human mind according to the principles of copyleft: freedom to use, copy, distribute, transform, and prohibition of exclusive appropriation.\r\n\r\nDefinitions\r\n\r\n\u201cwork\u201d either means the initial work, the subsequent works or the common work as defined hereafter:\r\n\r\n\u201ccommon work\u201d means a work composed of the initial work and all subsequent contributions to it (originals and copies). The initial author is the one who, by choosing this license, defines the conditions under which contributions are made.\r\n\r\n\u201cInitial work\u201d means the work created by the initiator of the common work (as defined above), the copies of which can be modified by whoever wants to\r\n\r\n\u201cSubsequent works\u201d means the contributions made by authors who participate in the evolution of the common work by exercising the rights to reproduce, distribute, and modify that are granted by the license.\r\n\r\n\u201cOriginals\u201d (sources or resources of the work) means all copies of either the initial work or any subsequent work mentioning a date and used by their author(s) as references for any subsequent updates, interpretations, copies or reproductions.\r\n\r\n\u201cCopy\u201d means any reproduction of an original as defined by this license.\r\n\r\n1. OBJECT \r\nThe aim of this license is to define the conditions under which one can use this work freely.\r\n\r\n2. SCOPE \r\nThis work is subject to copyright law. Through this license its author specifies the extent to which you can copy, distribute, and modify it.\r\n\r\n2.1 FREEDOM TO COPY (OR TO MAKE REPRODUCTIONS) \r\nYou have the right to copy this work for yourself, your friends or any other person, whatever the technique used.\r\n\r\n2.2 FREEDOM TO DISTRIBUTE, TO PERFORM IN PUBLIC \r\nYou have the right to distribute copies of this work; whether modified or not, whatever the medium and the place, with or without any charge, provided that you:\r\nattach this license without any modification to the copies of this work or indicate precisely where the license can be found,\r\nspecify to the recipient the names of the author(s) of the originals, including yours if you have modified the work,\r\nspecify to the recipient where to access the originals (either initial or subsequent).\r\nThe authors of the originals may, if they wish to, give you the right to distribute the originals under the same conditions as the copies.\r\n\r\n2.3 FREEDOM TO MODIFY \r\nYou have the right to modify copies of the originals (whether initial or subsequent) provided you comply with the following conditions:\r\nall conditions in article 2.2 above, if you distribute modified copies;\r\nindicate that the work has been modified and, if it is possible, what kind of modifications have been made;\r\ndistribute the subsequent work under the same license or any compatible license.\r\nThe author(s) of the original work may give you the right to modify it under the same conditions as the copies.\r\n\r\n3. RELATED RIGHTS \r\nActivities giving rise to author\u2019s rights and related rights shall not challenge the rights granted by this license.\r\nFor example, this is the reason why performances must be subject to the same license or a compatible license. Similarly, integrating the work in a database, a compilation or an anthology shall not prevent anyone from using the work under the same conditions as those defined in this license.\r\n\r\n4. INCORPORATION OF THE WORK \r\nIncorporating this work into a larger work that is not subject to the Free Art License shall not challenge the rights granted by this license.\r\nIf the work can no longer be accessed apart from the larger work in which it is incorporated, then incorporation shall only be allowed under the condition that the larger work is subject either to the Free Art License or a compatible license.\r\n\r\n5. COMPATIBILITY \r\nA license is compatible with the Free Art License provided:\r\nit gives the right to copy, distribute, and modify copies of the work including for commercial purposes and without any other restrictions than those required by the respect of the other compatibility criteria;\r\nit ensures proper attribution of the work to its authors and access to previous versions of the work when possible;\r\nit recognizes the Free Art License as compatible (reciprocity);\r\nit requires that changes made to the work be subject to the same license or to a license which also meets these compatibility criteria.\r\n\r\n6. YOUR INTELLECTUAL RIGHTS \r\nThis license does not aim at denying your author's rights in your contribution or any related right. By choosing to contribute to the development of this common work, you only agree to grant others the same rights with regard to your contribution as those you were granted by this license. Conferring these rights does not mean you have to give up your intellectual rights.\r\n\r\n7. YOUR RESPONSIBILITIES \r\nThe freedom to use the work as defined by the Free Art License (right to copy, distribute, modify) implies that everyone is responsible for their own actions.\r\n\r\n8. DURATION OF THE LICENSE \r\nThis license takes effect as of your acceptance of its terms. The act of copying, distributing, or modifying the work constitutes a tacit agreement. This license will remain in effect for as long as the copyright which is attached to the work. If you do not respect the terms of this license, you automatically lose the rights that it confers.\r\nIf the legal status or legislation to which you are subject makes it impossible for you to respect the terms of this license, you may not make use of the rights which it confers.\r\n\r\n9. VARIOUS VERSIONS OF THE LICENSE \r\nThis license may undergo periodic modifications to incorporate improvements by its authors (instigators of the \u201cCopyleft Attitude\u201d movement) by way of new, numbered versions.\r\nYou will always have the choice of accepting the terms contained in the version under which the copy of the work was distributed to you, or alternatively, to use the provisions of one of the subsequent versions.\r\n\r\n10. SUB-LICENSING \r\nSub-licenses are not authorized by this license. Any person wishing to make use of the rights that it confers will be directly bound to the authors of the common work.\r\n\r\n11. LEGAL FRAMEWORK\r\nThis license is written with respect to both French law and the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works.\r\n\r\nUSER GUIDE\r\n\r\n- How to use the Free Art License? \r\nTo benefit from the Free Art License, you only need to mention the following elements on your work:\r\n[Name of the author, title, date of the work. When applicable, names of authors of the common work and, if possible, where to find the originals].\r\nCopyleft: This is a free work, you can copy, distribute, and modify it under the terms of the Free Art License http:\/\/artlibre.org\/licence\/lal\/en\/\r\n\r\n- Why to use the Free Art License? \r\n1.To give the greatest number of people access to your work.\r\n2.To allow it to be distributed freely.\r\n3.To allow it to evolve by allowing its copy, distribution, and transformation by others.\r\n4.So that you benefit from the resources of a work when it is under the Free Art License: to be able to copy, distribute or transform it freely.\r\n5.But also, because the Free Art License offers a legal framework to disallow any misappropriation. It is forbidden to take hold of your work and bypass the creative process for one's exclusive possession.\r\n\r\n- When to use the Free Art License? \r\nAny time you want to benefit and make others benefit from the right to copy, distribute and transform creative works without any exclusive appropriation, you should use the Free Art License. You can for example use it for scientific, artistic or educational projects.\r\n\r\n- What kinds of works can be subject to the Free Art License? \r\nThe Free Art License can be applied to digital as well as physical works.\r\nYou can choose to apply the Free Art License on any text, picture, sound, gesture, or whatever sort of stuff on which you have sufficient author's rights.\r\n\r\n- Historical background of this license: \r\nIt is the result of observing, using and creating digital technologies, free software, the Internet and art. It arose from the \u201cCopyleft Attitude\u201d meetings which took place in Paris in 2000. For the first time, these meetings brought together members of the Free Software community, artists, and members of the art world. The goal was to adapt the principles of Copyleft and free software to all sorts of creations. http:\/\/www.artlibre.org\r\n\r\nCopyleft Attitude, 2007.\r\nYou can make reproductions and distribute this license verbatim (without any changes).\r\n\r\nTranslation : Jonathan Clarke, Benjamin Jean, Griselda Jung, Fanny Mourguet, Antoine Pitrou.\r\nThanks to framalang.org",

The license\r\n  affects  thus  the  FreeType   font  engine,  the  test  programs,\r\n  documentation and makefiles, at the very least.\r\n\r\n  This  license   was  inspired  by  the  BSD,   Artistic,  and  IJG\r\n  (Independent JPEG  Group) licenses, which  all encourage inclusion\r\n  and  use of  free  software in  commercial  and freeware  products\r\n  alike.  As a consequence, its main points are that:\r\n\r\n    o We don't promise that this software works. However, we will be\r\n      interested in any kind of bug reports. (`as is' distribution)\r\n\r\n    o You can  use this software for whatever you  want, in parts or\r\n      full form, without having to pay us. (`royalty-free' usage)\r\n\r\n    o You may not pretend that  you wrote this software.  If you use\r\n      it, or  only parts of it,  in a program,  you must acknowledge\r\n      somewhere  in  your  documentation  that  you  have  used  the\r\n      FreeType code. (`credits')\r\n\r\n  We  specifically  permit  and  encourage  the  inclusion  of  this\r\n  software, with  or without modifications,  in commercial products.\r\n  We  disclaim  all warranties  covering  The  FreeType Project  and\r\n  assume no liability related to The FreeType Project.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Finally,  many  people  asked  us  for  a  preferred  form  for  a\r\n  credit\/disclaimer to use in compliance with this license.  We thus\r\n  encourage you to use the following text:\r\n\r\n   \"\"\"  \r\n    Portions of this software are copyright \u00a9 <year> The FreeType\r\n    Project (www.freetype.org).  All rights reserved.\r\n   \"\"\"\r\n\r\n  Please replace <year> with the value from the FreeType version you\r\n  actually use.\r\n\r\n\r\nLegal Terms\r\n===========\r\n\r\n0. Definitions\r\n--------------\r\n\r\n  Throughout this license,  the terms `package', `FreeType Project',\r\n  and  `FreeType  archive' refer  to  the  set  of files  originally\r\n  distributed  by the  authors  (David Turner,  Robert Wilhelm,  and\r\n  Werner Lemberg) as the `FreeType Project', be they named as alpha,\r\n  beta or final release.\r\n\r\n  `You' refers to  the licensee, or person using  the project, where\r\n  `using' is a generic term including compiling the project's source\r\n  code as  well as linking it  to form a  `program' or `executable'.\r\n  This  program is  referred to  as  `a program  using the  FreeType\r\n  engine'.\r\n\r\n  This  license applies  to all  files distributed  in  the original\r\n  FreeType  Project,   including  all  source   code,  binaries  and\r\n  documentation,  unless  otherwise  stated   in  the  file  in  its\r\n  original, unmodified form as  distributed in the original archive.\r\n  If you are  unsure whether or not a particular  file is covered by\r\n  this license, you must contact us to verify this.\r\n\r\n  The FreeType  Project is copyright (C) 1996-2000  by David Turner,\r\n  Robert Wilhelm, and Werner Lemberg.  All rights reserved except as\r\n  specified below.\r\n\r\n1. No Warranty\r\n--------------\r\n\r\n  THE FREETYPE PROJECT  IS PROVIDED `AS IS' WITHOUT  WARRANTY OF ANY\r\n  KIND, EITHER  EXPRESS OR IMPLIED,  INCLUDING, BUT NOT  LIMITED TO,\r\n  WARRANTIES  OF  MERCHANTABILITY   AND  FITNESS  FOR  A  PARTICULAR\r\n  PURPOSE.  IN NO EVENT WILL ANY OF THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS\r\n  BE LIABLE  FOR ANY DAMAGES CAUSED  BY THE USE OR  THE INABILITY TO\r\n  USE, OF THE FREETYPE PROJECT.\r\n\r\n2. Redistribution\r\n-----------------\r\n\r\n  This  license  grants  a  worldwide, royalty-free,  perpetual  and\r\n  irrevocable right  and license to use,  execute, perform, compile,\r\n  display,  copy,   create  derivative  works   of,  distribute  and\r\n  sublicense the  FreeType Project (in  both source and  object code\r\n  forms)  and  derivative works  thereof  for  any  purpose; and  to\r\n  authorize others  to exercise  some or all  of the  rights granted\r\n  herein, subject to the following conditions:\r\n\r\n    o Redistribution of  source code  must retain this  license file\r\n      (`FTL.TXT') unaltered; any  additions, deletions or changes to\r\n      the original  files must be clearly  indicated in accompanying\r\n      documentation.   The  copyright   notices  of  the  unaltered,\r\n      original  files must  be  preserved in  all  copies of  source\r\n      files.\r\n\r\n    o Redistribution in binary form must provide a  disclaimer  that\r\n      states  that  the software is based in part of the work of the\r\n      FreeType Team,  in  the  distribution  documentation.  We also\r\n      encourage you to put an URL to the FreeType web page  in  your\r\n      documentation, though this isn't mandatory.\r\n\r\n  These conditions  apply to any  software derived from or  based on\r\n  the FreeType Project,  not just the unmodified files.   If you use\r\n  our work, you  must acknowledge us.  However, no  fee need be paid\r\n  to us.\r\n\r\n3. Advertising\r\n--------------\r\n\r\n  Neither the  FreeType authors and  contributors nor you  shall use\r\n  the name of the  other for commercial, advertising, or promotional\r\n  purposes without specific prior written permission.\r\n\r\n  We suggest,  but do not require, that  you use one or  more of the\r\n  following phrases to refer  to this software in your documentation\r\n  or advertising  materials: `FreeType Project',  `FreeType Engine',\r\n  `FreeType library', or `FreeType Distribution'.\r\n\r\n  As  you have  not signed  this license,  you are  not  required to\r\n  accept  it.   However,  as  the FreeType  Project  is  copyrighted\r\n  material, only  this license, or  another one contracted  with the\r\n  authors, grants you  the right to use, distribute,  and modify it.\r\n  Therefore,  by  using,  distributing,  or modifying  the  FreeType\r\n  Project, you indicate that you understand and accept all the terms\r\n  of this license.\r\n\r\n4. Contacts\r\n-----------\r\n\r\n  There are two mailing lists related to FreeType:\r\n\r\n    o freetype@nongnu.org\r\n\r\n      Discusses general use and applications of FreeType, as well as\r\n      future and  wanted additions to the  library and distribution.\r\n      If  you are looking  for support,  start in  this list  if you\r\n      haven't found anything to help you in the documentation.\r\n\r\n    o freetype-devel@nongnu.org\r\n\r\n      Discusses bugs,  as well  as engine internals,  design issues,\r\n      specific licenses, porting, etc.\r\n\r\n  Our home page can be found at\r\n\r\n    http:\/\/www.freetype.org\r\n\r\n\r\n--- end of FTL.TXT ---",

PREAMBLE\r\n\r\nThe purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other written document \"free\" in the sense of freedom: to assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it, with or without modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially. Secondarily, this License preserves for the author and publisher a way to get credit for their work, while not being considered responsible for modifications made by others.\r\n\r\nThis License is a kind of \"copyleft\", which means that derivative works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense. It complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft license designed for free software.\r\n\r\nWe have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free software, because free software needs free documentation: a free program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the software does. But this License is not limited to software manuals; it can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or whether it is published as a printed book. We recommend this License principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference.\r\n\r\n1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS\r\n\r\nThis License applies to any manual or other work that contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be distributed under the terms of this License. The \"Document\", below, refers to any such manual or work. Any member of the public is a licensee, and is addressed as \"you\".\r\n\r\nA \"Modified Version\" of the Document means any work containing the Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with modifications and\/or translated into another language.\r\n\r\nA \"Secondary Section\" is a named appendix or a front-matter section of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall directly within that overall subject. (For example, if the Document is in part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any mathematics.) The relationship could be a matter of historical connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding them.\r\n\r\nThe \"Invariant Sections\" are certain Secondary Sections whose titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice that says that the Document is released under this License.\r\n\r\nThe \"Cover Texts\" are certain short passages of text that are listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that the Document is released under this License.\r\n\r\nA \"Transparent\" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy, represented in a format whose specification is available to the general public, whose contents can be viewed and edited directly and straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input to text formatters. A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file format whose markup has been designed to thwart or discourage subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent. A copy that is not \"Transparent\" is called \"Opaque\".\r\n\r\nExamples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple HTML designed for human modification. Opaque formats include PostScript, PDF, proprietary formats that can be read and edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD and\/or processing tools are not generally available, and the machine-generated HTML produced by some word processors for output purposes only.\r\n\r\nThe \"Title Page\" means, for a printed book, the title page itself, plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material this License requires to appear in the title page. For works in formats which do not have any title page as such, \"Title Page\" means the text near the most prominent appearance of the work's title, preceding the beginning of the body of the text.\r\n\r\n2. VERBATIM COPYING\r\n\r\nYou may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other conditions whatsoever to those of this License. You may not use technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further copying of the copies you make or distribute. However, you may accept compensation in exchange for copies. If you distribute a large enough number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.\r\n\r\nYou may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and you may publicly display copies.\r\n\r\n3. COPYING IN QUANTITY\r\n\r\nIf you publish printed copies of the Document numbering more than 100, and the Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on the back cover. Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies. The front cover must present the full title with all words of the title equally prominent and visible. You may add other material on the covers in addition. Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in other respects.\r\n\r\nIf the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent pages.\r\n\r\nIf you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy a publicly-accessible computer-network location containing a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material, which the general network-using public has access to download anonymously at no charge using public-standard network protocols. If you use the latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated location until at least one year after the last time you distribute an Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that edition to the public.\r\n\r\nIt is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document.\r\n\r\n4. MODIFICATIONS\r\n\r\nYou may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy of it. In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:\r\n\r\nA. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions (which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section of the Document). You may use the same title as a previous version if the original publisher of that version gives permission.\r\nB. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified Version, together with at least five of the principal authors of the Document (all of its principal authors, if it has less than five).\r\nC. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the Modified Version, as the publisher.\r\nD. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.\r\nE. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications adjacent to the other copyright notices.\r\nF. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.\r\nG. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections and required Cover Texts given in the Document's license notice.\r\nH. Include an unaltered copy of this License.\r\nI. Preserve the section entitled \"History\", and its title, and add to it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page. If there is no section entitled \"History\" in the Document, create one stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified Version as stated in the previous sentence.\r\nJ. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise the network locations given in the Document for previous versions it was based on. These may be placed in the \"History\" section. You may omit a network location for a work that was published at least four years before the Document itself, or if the original publisher of the version it refers to gives permission.\r\nK. In any section entitled \"Acknowledgements\" or \"Dedications\", preserve the section's title, and preserve in the section all the substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements and\/or dedications given therein.\r\nL. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document, unaltered in their text and in their titles. Section numbers or the equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.\r\nM. Delete any section entitled \"Endorsements\". Such a section may not be included in the Modified Version.\r\nN. Do not retitle any existing section as \"Endorsements\" or to conflict in title with any Invariant Section.\r\nIf the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all of these sections as invariant. To do this, add their titles to the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's license notice. These titles must be distinct from any other section titles.\r\n\r\nYou may add a section entitled \"Endorsements\", provided it contains nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various parties--for example, statements of peer review or that the text has been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a standard.\r\n\r\nYou may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version. Only one passage of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or through arrangements made by) any one entity. If the Document already includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of, you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit permission from the previous publisher that added the old one.\r\n\r\nThe author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or imply endorsement of any Modified Version.\r\n\r\n5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS\r\n\r\nYou may combine the Document with other documents released under this License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its license notice.\r\n\r\nThe combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single copy. If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but different contents, make the title of each such section unique by adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original author or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number. Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work.\r\n\r\nIn the combination, you must combine any sections entitled \"History\" in the various original documents, forming one section entitled \"History\"; likewise combine any sections entitled \"Acknowledgements\", and any sections entitled \"Dedications\". You must delete all sections entitled \"Endorsements.\"\r\n\r\n6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS\r\n\r\nYou may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents released under this License, and replace the individual copies of this License in the various documents with a single copy that is included in the collection, provided that you follow the rules of this License for verbatim copying of each of the documents in all other respects.\r\n\r\nYou may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow this License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of that document.\r\n\r\n7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS\r\n\r\nA compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, does not as a whole count as a Modified Version of the Document, provided no compilation copyright is claimed for the compilation. Such a compilation is called an \"aggregate\", and this License does not apply to the other self-contained works thus compiled with the Document, on account of their being thus compiled, if they are not themselves derivative works of the Document.\r\n\r\nIf the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one quarter of the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed on covers that surround only the Document within the aggregate. Otherwise they must appear on covers around the whole aggregate.\r\n\r\n8. TRANSLATION\r\n\r\nTranslation is considered a kind of modification, so you may distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4. Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special permission from their copyright holders, but you may include translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the original versions of these Invariant Sections. You may include a translation of this License provided that you also include the original English version of this License. In case of a disagreement between the translation and the original English version of this License, the original English version will prevail.\r\n\r\n9. TERMINATION\r\n\r\nYou may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document except as expressly provided for under this License. Any other attempt to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Document is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.\r\n\r\n10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE\r\n\r\nThe Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns. See http:\/\/www.gnu.org\/copyleft\/.\r\n\r\nEach version of the License is given a distinguishing version number. If the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this License \"or any later version\" applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that specified version or of any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation. If the Document does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose any version ever published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.\r\n\r\nHow to use this License for your documents\r\n\r\nTo use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of the License in the document and put the following copyright and license notices just after the title page:\r\n\r\n      Copyright (c)  YEAR  YOUR NAME.\r\n      Permission is granted to copy, distribute and\/or modify this document\r\n      under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.1\r\n      or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;\r\n      with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with the\r\n      Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts being LIST.\r\n      A copy of the license is included in the section entitled \"GNU\r\n      Free Documentation License\".\r\nIf you have no Invariant Sections, write \"with no Invariant Sections\" instead of saying which ones are invariant. If you have no Front-Cover Texts, write \"no Front-Cover Texts\" instead of \"Front-Cover Texts being LIST\"; likewise for Back-Cover Texts.\r\n\r\nIf your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of free software license, such as the GNU General Public License, to permit their use in free software.",

PREAMBLE\r\n\r\nThe purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other functional and useful document \"free\" in the sense of freedom: to assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it, with or without modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially. Secondarily, this License preserves for the author and publisher a way to get credit for their work, while not being considered responsible for modifications made by others.\r\n\r\nThis License is a kind of \"copyleft\", which means that derivative works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense. It complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft license designed for free software.\r\n\r\nWe have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free software, because free software needs free documentation: a free program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the software does. But this License is not limited to software manuals; it can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or whether it is published as a printed book. We recommend this License principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference.\r\n\r\n1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS\r\n\r\nThis License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium, that contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be distributed under the terms of this License. Such a notice grants a world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration, to use that work under the conditions stated herein. The \"Document\", below, refers to any such manual or work. Any member of the public is a licensee, and is addressed as \"you\". You accept the license if you copy, modify or distribute the work in a way requiring permission under copyright law.\r\n\r\nA \"Modified Version\" of the Document means any work containing the Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with modifications and\/or translated into another language.\r\n\r\nA \"Secondary Section\" is a named appendix or a front-matter section of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall directly within that overall subject. (Thus, if the Document is in part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any mathematics.) The relationship could be a matter of historical connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding them.\r\n\r\nThe \"Invariant Sections\" are certain Secondary Sections whose titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice that says that the Document is released under this License. If a section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it is not allowed to be designated as Invariant. The Document may contain zero Invariant Sections. If the Document does not identify any Invariant Sections then there are none.\r\n\r\nThe \"Cover Texts\" are certain short passages of text that are listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that the Document is released under this License. A Front-Cover Text may be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25 words.\r\n\r\nA \"Transparent\" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy, represented in a format whose specification is available to the general public, that is suitable for revising the document straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input to text formatters. A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file format whose markup, or absence of markup, has been arranged to thwart or discourage subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent. An image format is not Transparent if used for any substantial amount of text. A copy that is not \"Transparent\" is called \"Opaque\".\r\n\r\nExamples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for human modification. Examples of transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG. Opaque formats include proprietary formats that can be read and edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD and\/or processing tools are not generally available, and the machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word processors for output purposes only.\r\n\r\nThe \"Title Page\" means, for a printed book, the title page itself, plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material this License requires to appear in the title page. For works in formats which do not have any title page as such, \"Title Page\" means the text near the most prominent appearance of the work's title, preceding the beginning of the body of the text.\r\n\r\nA section \"Entitled XYZ\" means a named subunit of the Document whose title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses following text that translates XYZ in another language. (Here XYZ stands for a specific section name mentioned below, such as \"Acknowledgements\", \"Dedications\", \"Endorsements\", or \"History\".) To \"Preserve the Title\" of such a section when you modify the Document means that it remains a section \"Entitled XYZ\" according to this definition.\r\n\r\nThe Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice which states that this License applies to the Document. These Warranty Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in this License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and has no effect on the meaning of this License.\r\n\r\n2. VERBATIM COPYING\r\n\r\nYou may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other conditions whatsoever to those of this License. You may not use technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further copying of the copies you make or distribute. However, you may accept compensation in exchange for copies. If you distribute a large enough number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.\r\n\r\nYou may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and you may publicly display copies.\r\n\r\n3. COPYING IN QUANTITY\r\n\r\nIf you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly have printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and the Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on the back cover. Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies. The front cover must present the full title with all words of the title equally prominent and visible. You may add other material on the covers in addition. Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in other respects.\r\n\r\nIf the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent pages.\r\n\r\nIf you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy a computer-network location from which the general network-using public has access to download using public-standard network protocols a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material. If you use the latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated location until at least one year after the last time you distribute an Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that edition to the public.\r\n\r\nIt is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document.\r\n\r\n4. MODIFICATIONS\r\n\r\nYou may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy of it. In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:\r\n\r\nA. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions (which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section of the Document). You may use the same title as a previous version if the original publisher of that version gives permission.\r\nB. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified Version, together with at least five of the principal authors of the Document (all of its principal authors, if it has fewer than five), unless they release you from this requirement.\r\nC. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the Modified Version, as the publisher.\r\nD. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.\r\nE. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications adjacent to the other copyright notices.\r\nF. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.\r\nG. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections and required Cover Texts given in the Document's license notice.\r\nH. Include an unaltered copy of this License.\r\nI. Preserve the section Entitled \"History\", Preserve its Title, and add to it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page. If there is no section Entitled \"History\" in the Document, create one stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified Version as stated in the previous sentence.\r\nJ. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise the network locations given in the Document for previous versions it was based on. These may be placed in the \"History\" section. You may omit a network location for a work that was published at least four years before the Document itself, or if the original publisher of the version it refers to gives permission.\r\nK. For any section Entitled \"Acknowledgements\" or \"Dedications\", Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the section all the substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements and\/or dedications given therein.\r\nL. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document, unaltered in their text and in their titles. Section numbers or the equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.\r\nM. Delete any section Entitled \"Endorsements\". Such a section may not be included in the Modified Version.\r\nN. Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled \"Endorsements\" or to conflict in title with any Invariant Section.\r\nO. Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.\r\nIf the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all of these sections as invariant. To do this, add their titles to the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's license notice. These titles must be distinct from any other section titles.\r\n\r\nYou may add a section Entitled \"Endorsements\", provided it contains nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various parties--for example, statements of peer review or that the text has been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a standard.\r\n\r\nYou may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version. Only one passage of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or through arrangements made by) any one entity. If the Document already includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of, you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit permission from the previous publisher that added the old one.\r\n\r\nThe author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or imply endorsement of any Modified Version.\r\n\r\n5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS\r\n\r\nYou may combine the Document with other documents released under this License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its license notice, and that you preserve all their Warranty Disclaimers.\r\n\r\nThe combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single copy. If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but different contents, make the title of each such section unique by adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original author or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number. Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work.\r\n\r\nIn the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled \"History\" in the various original documents, forming one section Entitled \"History\"; likewise combine any sections Entitled \"Acknowledgements\", and any sections Entitled \"Dedications\". You must delete all sections Entitled \"Endorsements.\"\r\n\r\n6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS\r\n\r\nYou may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents released under this License, and replace the individual copies of this License in the various documents with a single copy that is included in the collection, provided that you follow the rules of this License for verbatim copying of each of the documents in all other respects.\r\n\r\nYou may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow this License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of that document.\r\n\r\n7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS\r\n\r\nA compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an \"aggregate\" if the copyright resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the legal rights of the compilation's users beyond what the individual works permit. When the Document is included in an aggregate, this License does not apply to the other works in the aggregate which are not themselves derivative works of the Document.\r\n\r\nIf the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half of the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed on covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic form. Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket the whole aggregate.\r\n\r\n8. TRANSLATION\r\n\r\nTranslation is considered a kind of modification, so you may distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4. Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special permission from their copyright holders, but you may include translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the original versions of these Invariant Sections. You may include a translation of this License, and all the license notices in the Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also include the original English version of this License and the original versions of those notices and disclaimers. In case of a disagreement between the translation and the original version of this License or a notice or disclaimer, the original version will prevail.\r\n\r\nIf a section in the Document is Entitled \"Acknowledgements\", \"Dedications\", or \"History\", the requirement (section 4) to Preserve its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the actual title.\r\n\r\n9. TERMINATION\r\n\r\nYou may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document except as expressly provided for under this License. Any other attempt to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Document is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.\r\n\r\n10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE\r\n\r\nThe Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns. See http:\/\/www.gnu.org\/copyleft\/.\r\n\r\nEach version of the License is given a distinguishing version number. If the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this License \"or any later version\" applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that specified version or of any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation. If the Document does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose any version ever published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.",

APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS\r\nThis License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium, that contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be distributed under the terms of this License. Such a notice grants a world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration, to use that work under the conditions stated herein. The \"Document\", below, refers to any such manual or work. Any member of the public is a licensee, and is addressed as \"you\". You accept the license if you copy, modify or distribute the work in a way requiring permission under copyright law.\r\n\r\nA \"Modified Version\" of the Document means any work containing the Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with modifications and\/or translated into another language.\r\n\r\nA \"Secondary Section\" is a named appendix or a front-matter section of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall directly within that overall subject. (Thus, if the Document is in part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any mathematics.) The relationship could be a matter of historical connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding them.\r\n\r\nThe \"Invariant Sections\" are certain Secondary Sections whose titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice that says that the Document is released under this License. If a section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it is not allowed to be designated as Invariant. The Document may contain zero Invariant Sections. If the Document does not identify any Invariant Sections then there are none.\r\n\r\nThe \"Cover Texts\" are certain short passages of text that are listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that the Document is released under this License. A Front-Cover Text may be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25 words.\r\n\r\nA \"Transparent\" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy, represented in a format whose specification is available to the general public, that is suitable for revising the document straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input to text formatters. A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file format whose markup, or absence of markup, has been arranged to thwart or discourage subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent. An image format is not Transparent if used for any substantial amount of text. A copy that is not \"Transparent\" is called \"Opaque\".\r\n\r\nExamples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for human modification. Examples of transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG. Opaque formats include proprietary formats that can be read and edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD and\/or processing tools are not generally available, and the machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word processors for output purposes only.\r\n\r\nThe \"Title Page\" means, for a printed book, the title page itself, plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material this License requires to appear in the title page. For works in formats which do not have any title page as such, \"Title Page\" means the text near the most prominent appearance of the work's title, preceding the beginning of the body of the text.\r\n\r\nThe \"publisher\" means any person or entity that distributes copies of the Document to the public.\r\n\r\nA section \"Entitled XYZ\" means a named subunit of the Document whose title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses following text that translates XYZ in another language. (Here XYZ stands for a specific section name mentioned below, such as \"Acknowledgements\", \"Dedications\", \"Endorsements\", or \"History\".) To \"Preserve the Title\" of such a section when you modify the Document means that it remains a section \"Entitled XYZ\" according to this definition.\r\n\r\nThe Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice which states that this License applies to the Document. These Warranty Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in this License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and has no effect on the meaning of this License.\r\n\r\n2. VERBATIM COPYING\r\nYou may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other conditions whatsoever to those of this License. You may not use technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further copying of the copies you make or distribute. However, you may accept compensation in exchange for copies. If you distribute a large enough number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.\r\n\r\nYou may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and you may publicly display copies.\r\n\r\n3. COPYING IN QUANTITY\r\nIf you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly have printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and the Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on the back cover. Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies. The front cover must present the full title with all words of the title equally prominent and visible. You may add other material on the covers in addition. Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in other respects.\r\n\r\nIf the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent pages.\r\n\r\nIf you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy a computer-network location from which the general network-using public has access to download using public-standard network protocols a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material. If you use the latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated location until at least one year after the last time you distribute an Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that edition to the public.\r\n\r\nIt is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document.\r\n\r\n4. MODIFICATIONS\r\nYou may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy of it. In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:\r\n\r\nA. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions (which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section of the Document). You may use the same title as a previous version if the original publisher of that version gives permission.\r\nB. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified Version, together with at least five of the principal authors of the Document (all of its principal authors, if it has fewer than five), unless they release you from this requirement.\r\nC. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the Modified Version, as the publisher.\r\nD. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.\r\nE. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications adjacent to the other copyright notices.\r\nF. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.\r\nG. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections and required Cover Texts given in the Document's license notice.\r\nH. Include an unaltered copy of this License.\r\nI. Preserve the section Entitled \"History\", Preserve its Title, and add to it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page. If there is no section Entitled \"History\" in the Document, create one stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified Version as stated in the previous sentence.\r\nJ. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise the network locations given in the Document for previous versions it was based on. These may be placed in the \"History\" section. You may omit a network location for a work that was published at least four years before the Document itself, or if the original publisher of the version it refers to gives permission.\r\nK. For any section Entitled \"Acknowledgements\" or \"Dedications\", Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the section all the substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements and\/or dedications given therein.\r\nL. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document, unaltered in their text and in their titles. Section numbers or the equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.\r\nM. Delete any section Entitled \"Endorsements\". Such a section may not be included in the Modified Version.\r\nN. Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled \"Endorsements\" or to conflict in title with any Invariant Section.\r\nO. Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.\r\nIf the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all of these sections as invariant. To do this, add their titles to the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's license notice. These titles must be distinct from any other section titles.\r\n\r\nYou may add a section Entitled \"Endorsements\", provided it contains nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various parties\u2014for example, statements of peer review or that the text has been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a standard.\r\n\r\nYou may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version. Only one passage of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or through arrangements made by) any one entity. If the Document already includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of, you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit permission from the previous publisher that added the old one.\r\n\r\nThe author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or imply endorsement of any Modified Version.\r\n\r\n5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS\r\nYou may combine the Document with other documents released under this License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its license notice, and that you preserve all their Warranty Disclaimers.\r\n\r\nThe combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single copy. If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but different contents, make the title of each such section unique by adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original author or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number. Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work.\r\n\r\nIn the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled \"History\" in the various original documents, forming one section Entitled \"History\"; likewise combine any sections Entitled \"Acknowledgements\", and any sections Entitled \"Dedications\". You must delete all sections Entitled \"Endorsements\".\r\n\r\n6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS\r\nYou may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents released under this License, and replace the individual copies of this License in the various documents with a single copy that is included in the collection, provided that you follow the rules of this License for verbatim copying of each of the documents in all other respects.\r\n\r\nYou may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow this License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of that document.\r\n\r\n7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS\r\nA compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an \"aggregate\" if the copyright resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the legal rights of the compilation's users beyond what the individual works permit. When the Document is included in an aggregate, this License does not apply to the other works in the aggregate which are not themselves derivative works of the Document.\r\n\r\nIf the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half of the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed on covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic form. Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket the whole aggregate.\r\n\r\n8. TRANSLATION\r\nTranslation is considered a kind of modification, so you may distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4. Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special permission from their copyright holders, but you may include translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the original versions of these Invariant Sections. You may include a translation of this License, and all the license notices in the Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also include the original English version of this License and the original versions of those notices and disclaimers. In case of a disagreement between the translation and the original version of this License or a notice or disclaimer, the original version will prevail.\r\n\r\nIf a section in the Document is Entitled \"Acknowledgements\", \"Dedications\", or \"History\", the requirement (section 4) to Preserve its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the actual title.\r\n\r\n9. TERMINATION\r\nYou may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.\r\n\r\nHowever, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.\r\n\r\nMoreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice.\r\n\r\nTermination of your rights under this section does not terminate the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under this License. If your rights have been terminated and not permanently reinstated, receipt of a copy of some or all of the same material does not give you any rights to use it.\r\n\r\n10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE\r\nThe Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns. See http:\/\/www.gnu.org\/copyleft\/.\r\n\r\nEach version of the License is given a distinguishing version number. If the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this License \"or any later version\" applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that specified version or of any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation. If the Document does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose any version ever published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation. If the Document specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of this License can be used, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the Document.\r\n\r\n11. RELICENSING\r\n\"Massive Multiauthor Collaboration Site\" (or \"MMC Site\") means any World Wide Web server that publishes copyrightable works and also provides prominent facilities for anybody to edit those works. A public wiki that anybody can edit is an example of such a server. A \"Massive Multiauthor Collaboration\" (or \"MMC\") contained in the site means any set of copyrightable works thus published on the MMC site.\r\n\r\n\"CC-BY-SA\" means the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 license published by Creative Commons Corporation, a not-for-profit corporation with a principal place of business in San Francisco, California, as well as future copyleft versions of that license published by that same organization.\r\n\r\n\"Incorporate\" means to publish or republish a Document, in whole or in part, as part of another Document.\r\n\r\nAn MMC is \"eligible for relicensing\" if it is licensed under this License, and if all works that were first published under this License somewhere other than this MMC, and subsequently incorporated in whole or in part into the MMC, (1) had no cover texts or invariant sections, and (2) were thus incorporated prior to November 1, 2008.\r\n\r\nThe operator of an MMC Site may republish an MMC contained in the site under CC-BY-SA on the same site at any time before August 1, 2009, provided the MMC is eligible for relicensing.",

By contrast, our General Public\r\nLicense is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free\r\nsoftware--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  The\r\nGeneral Public License applies to the Free Software Foundation's\r\nsoftware and to any other program whose authors commit to using it.\r\nYou can use it for your programs, too.\r\n\r\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\r\nprice.  Specifically, the General Public License is designed to make\r\nsure that you have the freedom to give away or sell copies of free\r\nsoftware, that you receive source code or can get it if you want it,\r\nthat you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free\r\nprograms; and that you know you can do these things.\r\n\r\n  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\r\nanyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.\r\nThese restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you\r\ndistribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.\r\n\r\n  For example, if you distribute copies of a such a program, whether\r\ngratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that\r\nyou have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the\r\nsource code.  And you must tell them their rights.\r\n\r\n  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and\r\n(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,\r\ndistribute and\/or modify the software.\r\n\r\n  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain\r\nthat everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free\r\nsoftware.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we\r\nwant its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so\r\nthat any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original\r\nauthors' reputations.\r\n\r\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\r\nmodification follow.\r\n\r\n                    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\r\n   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\r\n\r\n  0. This License Agreement applies to any program or other work which\r\ncontains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be\r\ndistributed under the terms of this General Public License.  The\r\n\"Program\", below, refers to any such program or work, and a \"work based\r\non the Program\" means either the Program or any work containing the\r\nProgram or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications.  Each\r\nlicensee is addressed as \"you\".\r\n\r\n  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source\r\ncode as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and\r\nappropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and\r\ndisclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this\r\nGeneral Public License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any\r\nother recipients of the Program a copy of this General Public License\r\nalong with the Program.  You may charge a fee for the physical act of\r\ntransferring a copy.\r\n\r\n  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of\r\nit, and copy and distribute such modifications under the terms of Paragraph\r\n1 above, provided that you also do the following:\r\n\r\n    a) cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that\r\n    you changed the files and the date of any change; and\r\n\r\n    b) cause the whole of any work that you distribute or publish, that\r\n    in whole or in part contains the Program or any part thereof, either\r\n    with or without modifications, to be licensed at no charge to all\r\n    third parties under the terms of this General Public License (except\r\n    that you may choose to grant warranty protection to some or all\r\n    third parties, at your option).\r\n\r\n    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when\r\n    run, you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use\r\n    in the simplest and most usual way, to print or display an\r\n    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice\r\n    that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a\r\n    warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these\r\n    conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this General\r\n    Public License.\r\n\r\n    d) You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a\r\n    copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in\r\n    exchange for a fee.\r\n\r\nMere aggregation of another independent work with the Program (or its\r\nderivative) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring\r\nthe other work under the scope of these terms.\r\n\r\n  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a portion or derivative of\r\nit, under Paragraph 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of\r\nParagraphs 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:\r\n\r\n    a) accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable\r\n    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of\r\n    Paragraphs 1 and 2 above; or,\r\n\r\n    b) accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three\r\n    years, to give any third party free (except for a nominal charge\r\n    for the cost of distribution) a complete machine-readable copy of the\r\n    corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of\r\n    Paragraphs 1 and 2 above; or,\r\n\r\n    c) accompany it with the information you received as to where the\r\n    corresponding source code may be obtained.  (This alternative is\r\n    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you\r\n    received the program in object code or executable form alone.)\r\n\r\nSource code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making\r\nmodifications to it.  For an executable file, complete source code means\r\nall the source code for all modules it contains; but, as a special\r\nexception, it need not include source code for modules which are standard\r\nlibraries that accompany the operating system on which the executable\r\nfile runs, or for standard header files or definitions files that\r\naccompany that operating system.\r\n\r\n  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, distribute or transfer the\r\nProgram except as expressly provided under this General Public License.\r\nAny attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, distribute or transfer\r\nthe Program is void, and will automatically terminate your rights to use\r\nthe Program under this License.  However, parties who have received\r\ncopies, or rights to use copies, from you under this General Public\r\nLicense will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties\r\nremain in full compliance.\r\n\r\n  5. By copying, distributing or modifying the Program (or any work based\r\non the Program) you indicate your acceptance of this license to do so,\r\nand all its terms and conditions.\r\n\r\n  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the\r\nProgram), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original\r\nlicensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these\r\nterms and conditions.  You may not impose any further restrictions on the\r\nrecipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\r\n\r\n  7. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and\/or new versions\r\nof the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will\r\nbe similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\r\naddress new problems or concerns.\r\n\r\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program\r\nspecifies a version number of the license which applies to it and \"any\r\nlater version\", you have the option of following the terms and conditions\r\neither of that version or of any later version published by the Free\r\nSoftware Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of\r\nthe license, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software\r\nFoundation.\r\n\r\n  8. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free\r\nprograms whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author\r\nto ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free\r\nSoftware Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes\r\nmake exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals\r\nof preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and\r\nof promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.\r\n\r\n                            NO WARRANTY\r\n\r\n  9. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY\r\nFOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN\r\nOTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND\/OR OTHER PARTIES\r\nPROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED\r\nOR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF\r\nMERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS\r\nTO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE\r\nPROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,\r\nREPAIR OR CORRECTION.\r\n\r\n  10. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\r\nWILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND\/OR\r\nREDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,\r\nINCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING\r\nOUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED\r\nTO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY\r\nYOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER\r\nPROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE\r\nPOSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\r\n\r\n                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\r\n\r\n        Appendix: How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\r\n\r\n  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest\r\npossible use to humanity, the best way to achieve this is to make it\r\nfree software which everyone can redistribute and change under these\r\nterms.\r\n\r\n  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest to\r\nattach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey\r\nthe exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the\r\n\"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\r\n\r\n    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\r\n    Copyright (C) 19yy  <name of author>\r\n\r\n    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and\/or modify\r\n    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\r\n    the Free Software Foundation; either version 1, or (at your option)\r\n    any later version.\r\n\r\n    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\r\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\r\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the\r\n    GNU General Public License for more details.\r\n\r\n    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License\r\n    along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software\r\n    Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston MA  02110-1301 USA\r\n\r\n\r\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\r\n\r\nIf the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this\r\nwhen it starts in an interactive mode:\r\n\r\n    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) 19xx name of author\r\n    Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.\r\n    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it\r\n    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.\r\n\r\nThe hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the\r\nappropriate parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the\r\ncommands you use may be called something other than `show w' and `show\r\nc'; they could even be mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your\r\nprogram.\r\n\r\nYou should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your\r\nschool, if any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if\r\nnecessary.  Here a sample; alter the names:\r\n\r\n  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the\r\n  program `Gnomovision' (a program to direct compilers to make passes\r\n  at assemblers) written by James Hacker.\r\n\r\n  <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1989\r\n  Ty Coon, President of Vice\r\n\r\nThat's all there is to it!",

By contrast,\r\nthe GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to\r\nshare and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free\r\nsoftware for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the\r\nGNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to\r\nany other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to\r\nyour programs, too.\r\n\r\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\r\nprice.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\r\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\r\nthem if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you\r\nwant it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new\r\nfree programs, and that you know you can do these things.\r\n\r\n  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you\r\nthese rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have\r\ncertain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if\r\nyou modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.\r\n\r\n  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\r\ngratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same\r\nfreedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive\r\nor can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they\r\nknow their rights.\r\n\r\n  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:\r\n(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License\r\ngiving you legal permission to copy, distribute and\/or modify it.\r\n\r\n  For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains\r\nthat there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and\r\nauthors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as\r\nchanged, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to\r\nauthors of previous versions.\r\n\r\n  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run\r\nmodified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer\r\ncan do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of\r\nprotecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic\r\npattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to\r\nuse, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we\r\nhave designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those\r\nproducts.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we\r\nstand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions\r\nof the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.\r\n\r\n  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.\r\nStates should not allow patents to restrict development and use of\r\nsoftware on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to\r\navoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could\r\nmake it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that\r\npatents cannot be used to render the program non-free.\r\n\r\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\r\nmodification follow.\r\n\r\n                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS\r\n\r\n  0. Definitions.\r\n\r\n  \"This License\" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.\r\n\r\n  \"Copyright\" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of\r\nworks, such as semiconductor masks.\r\n\r\n  \"The Program\" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this\r\nLicense.  Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".  \"Licensees\" and\r\n\"recipients\" may be individuals or organizations.\r\n\r\n  To \"modify\" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work\r\nin a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an\r\nexact copy.  The resulting work is called a \"modified version\" of the\r\nearlier work or a work \"based on\" the earlier work.\r\n\r\n  A \"covered work\" means either the unmodified Program or a work based\r\non the Program.\r\n\r\n  To \"propagate\" a work means to do anything with it that, without\r\npermission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for\r\ninfringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a\r\ncomputer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,\r\ndistribution (with or without modification), making available to the\r\npublic, and in some countries other activities as well.\r\n\r\n  To \"convey\" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other\r\nparties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through\r\na computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.\r\n\r\n  An interactive user interface displays \"Appropriate Legal Notices\"\r\nto the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible\r\nfeature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)\r\ntells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the\r\nextent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the\r\nwork under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If\r\nthe interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a\r\nmenu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.\r\n\r\n  1. Source Code.\r\n\r\n  The \"source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work\r\nfor making modifications to it.  \"Object code\" means any non-source\r\nform of a work.\r\n\r\n  A \"Standard Interface\" means an interface that either is an official\r\nstandard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of\r\ninterfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that\r\nis widely used among developers working in that language.\r\n\r\n  The \"System Libraries\" of an executable work include anything, other\r\nthan the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of\r\npackaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major\r\nComponent, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that\r\nMajor Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an\r\nimplementation is available to the public in source code form.  A\r\n\"Major Component\", in this context, means a major essential component\r\n(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system\r\n(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to\r\nproduce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.\r\n\r\n  The \"Corresponding Source\" for a work in object code form means all\r\nthe source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable\r\nwork) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to\r\ncontrol those activities.  However, it does not include the work's\r\nSystem Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free\r\nprograms which are used unmodified in performing those activities but\r\nwhich are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source\r\nincludes interface definition files associated with source files for\r\nthe work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically\r\nlinked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,\r\nsuch as by intimate data communication or control flow between those\r\nsubprograms and other parts of the work.\r\n\r\n  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users\r\ncan regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding\r\nSource.\r\n\r\n  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that\r\nsame work.\r\n\r\n  2. Basic Permissions.\r\n\r\n  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of\r\ncopyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated\r\nconditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited\r\npermission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a\r\ncovered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its\r\ncontent, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your\r\nrights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.\r\n\r\n  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not\r\nconvey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains\r\nin force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose\r\nof having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you\r\nwith facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with\r\nthe terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do\r\nnot control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works\r\nfor you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction\r\nand control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of\r\nyour copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.\r\n\r\n  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under\r\nthe conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10\r\nmakes it unnecessary.\r\n\r\n  3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.\r\n\r\n  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological\r\nmeasure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article\r\n11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or\r\nsimilar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such\r\nmeasures.\r\n\r\n  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid\r\ncircumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention\r\nis effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to\r\nthe covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or\r\nmodification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's\r\nusers, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of\r\ntechnological measures.\r\n\r\n  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.\r\n\r\n  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you\r\nreceive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and\r\nappropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;\r\nkeep intact all notices stating that this License and any\r\nnon-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;\r\nkeep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all\r\nrecipients a copy of this License along with the Program.\r\n\r\n  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,\r\nand you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.\r\n\r\n  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.\r\n\r\n  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to\r\nproduce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the\r\nterms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\r\n\r\n    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified\r\n    it, and giving a relevant date.\r\n\r\n    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is\r\n    released under this License and any conditions added under section\r\n    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to\r\n    \"keep intact all notices\".\r\n\r\n    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this\r\n    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This\r\n    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7\r\n    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,\r\n    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no\r\n    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not\r\n    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.\r\n\r\n    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display\r\n    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive\r\n    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your\r\n    work need not make them do so.\r\n\r\n  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent\r\nworks, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,\r\nand which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,\r\nin or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an\r\n\"aggregate\" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not\r\nused to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users\r\nbeyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work\r\nin an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other\r\nparts of the aggregate.\r\n\r\n  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.\r\n\r\n  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms\r\nof sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the\r\nmachine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,\r\nin one of these ways:\r\n\r\n    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\r\n    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the\r\n    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium\r\n    customarily used for software interchange.\r\n\r\n    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\r\n    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a\r\n    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as\r\n    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product\r\n    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a\r\n    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the\r\n    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical\r\n    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no\r\n    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this\r\n    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the\r\n    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.\r\n\r\n    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the\r\n    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This\r\n    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and\r\n    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord\r\n    with subsection 6b.\r\n\r\n    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated\r\n    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the\r\n    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no\r\n    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the\r\n    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to\r\n    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source\r\n    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)\r\n    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain\r\n    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the\r\n    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the\r\n    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is\r\n    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.\r\n\r\n    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided\r\n    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding\r\n    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no\r\n    charge under subsection 6d.\r\n\r\n  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded\r\nfrom the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be\r\nincluded in conveying the object code work.\r\n\r\n  A \"User Product\" is either (1) a \"consumer product\", which means any\r\ntangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,\r\nor household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation\r\ninto a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,\r\ndoubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular\r\nproduct received by a particular user, \"normally used\" refers to a\r\ntypical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status\r\nof the particular user or of the way in which the particular user\r\nactually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product\r\nis a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial\r\ncommercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent\r\nthe only significant mode of use of the product.\r\n\r\n  \"Installation Information\" for a User Product means any methods,\r\nprocedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install\r\nand execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from\r\na modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must\r\nsuffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object\r\ncode is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because\r\nmodification has been made.\r\n\r\n  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or\r\nspecifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as\r\npart of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the\r\nUser Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a\r\nfixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the\r\nCorresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied\r\nby the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply\r\nif neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install\r\nmodified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has\r\nbeen installed in ROM).\r\n\r\n  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a\r\nrequirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates\r\nfor a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for\r\nthe User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a\r\nnetwork may be denied when the modification itself materially and\r\nadversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and\r\nprotocols for communication across the network.\r\n\r\n  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,\r\nin accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly\r\ndocumented (and with an implementation available to the public in\r\nsource code form), and must require no special password or key for\r\nunpacking, reading or copying.\r\n\r\n  7. Additional Terms.\r\n\r\n  \"Additional permissions\" are terms that supplement the terms of this\r\nLicense by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.\r\nAdditional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall\r\nbe treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent\r\nthat they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions\r\napply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately\r\nunder those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by\r\nthis License without regard to the additional permissions.\r\n\r\n  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option\r\nremove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of\r\nit.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own\r\nremoval in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place\r\nadditional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,\r\nfor which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.\r\n\r\n  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you\r\nadd to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of\r\nthat material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:\r\n\r\n    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the\r\n    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or\r\n\r\n    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or\r\n    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal\r\n    Notices displayed by works containing it; or\r\n\r\n    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or\r\n    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in\r\n    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or\r\n\r\n    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or\r\n    authors of the material; or\r\n\r\n    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some\r\n    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or\r\n\r\n    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that\r\n    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of\r\n    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for\r\n    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on\r\n    those licensors and authors.\r\n\r\n  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered \"further\r\nrestrictions\" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you\r\nreceived it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is\r\ngoverned by this License along with a term that is a further\r\nrestriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains\r\na further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this\r\nLicense, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms\r\nof that license document, provided that the further restriction does\r\nnot survive such relicensing or conveying.\r\n\r\n  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you\r\nmust place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the\r\nadditional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating\r\nwhere to find the applicable terms.\r\n\r\n  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the\r\nform of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;\r\nthe above requirements apply either way.\r\n\r\n  8. Termination.\r\n\r\n  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly\r\nprovided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or\r\nmodify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under\r\nthis License (including any patent licenses granted under the third\r\nparagraph of section 11).\r\n\r\n  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your\r\nlicense from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)\r\nprovisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and\r\nfinally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright\r\nholder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means\r\nprior to 60 days after the cessation.\r\n\r\n  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is\r\nreinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the\r\nviolation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have\r\nreceived notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that\r\ncopyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after\r\nyour receipt of the notice.\r\n\r\n  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the\r\nlicenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under\r\nthis License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently\r\nreinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same\r\nmaterial under section 10.\r\n\r\n  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.\r\n\r\n  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or\r\nrun a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work\r\noccurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission\r\nto receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,\r\nnothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or\r\nmodify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do\r\nnot accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a\r\ncovered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.\r\n\r\n  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.\r\n\r\n  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically\r\nreceives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and\r\npropagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible\r\nfor enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.\r\n\r\n  An \"entity transaction\" is a transaction transferring control of an\r\norganization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an\r\norganization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered\r\nwork results from an entity transaction, each party to that\r\ntransaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever\r\nlicenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could\r\ngive under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the\r\nCorresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if\r\nthe predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.\r\n\r\n  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the\r\nrights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may\r\nnot impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of\r\nrights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation\r\n(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that\r\nany patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for\r\nsale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.\r\n\r\n  11. Patents.\r\n\r\n  A \"contributor\" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this\r\nLicense of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The\r\nwork thus licensed is called the contributor's \"contributor version\".\r\n\r\n  A contributor's \"essential patent claims\" are all patent claims\r\nowned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or\r\nhereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted\r\nby this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,\r\nbut do not include claims that would be infringed only as a\r\nconsequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For\r\npurposes of this definition, \"control\" includes the right to grant\r\npatent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of\r\nthis License.\r\n\r\n  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free\r\npatent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to\r\nmake, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and\r\npropagate the contents of its contributor version.\r\n\r\n  In the following three paragraphs, a \"patent license\" is any express\r\nagreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent\r\n(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to\r\nsue for patent infringement).  To \"grant\" such a patent license to a\r\nparty means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a\r\npatent against the party.\r\n\r\n  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,\r\nand the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone\r\nto copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a\r\npublicly available network server or other readily accessible means,\r\nthen you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so\r\navailable, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the\r\npatent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner\r\nconsistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent\r\nlicense to downstream recipients.  \"Knowingly relying\" means you have\r\nactual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the\r\ncovered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work\r\nin a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that\r\ncountry that you have reason to believe are valid.\r\n\r\n  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or\r\narrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a\r\ncovered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties\r\nreceiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify\r\nor convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license\r\nyou grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered\r\nwork and works based on it.\r\n\r\n  A patent license is \"discriminatory\" if it does not include within\r\nthe scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is\r\nconditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are\r\nspecifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered\r\nwork if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is\r\nin the business of distributing software, under which you make payment\r\nto the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying\r\nthe work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the\r\nparties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory\r\npatent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work\r\nconveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily\r\nfor and in connection with specific products or compilations that\r\ncontain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,\r\nor that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.\r\n\r\n  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting\r\nany implied license or other defenses to infringement that may\r\notherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.\r\n\r\n  12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.\r\n\r\n  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\r\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\r\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a\r\ncovered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\r\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may\r\nnot convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you\r\nto collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey\r\nthe Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this\r\nLicense would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.\r\n\r\n  13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.\r\n\r\n  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have\r\npermission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed\r\nunder version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single\r\ncombined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this\r\nLicense will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,\r\nbut the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,\r\nsection 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the\r\ncombination as such.\r\n\r\n  14. Revised Versions of this License.\r\n\r\n  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and\/or new versions of\r\nthe GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will\r\nbe similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\r\naddress new problems or concerns.\r\n\r\n  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the\r\nProgram specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General\r\nPublic License \"or any later version\" applies to it, you have the\r\noption of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered\r\nversion or of any later version published by the Free Software\r\nFoundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the\r\nGNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published\r\nby the Free Software Foundation.\r\n\r\n  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future\r\nversions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's\r\npublic statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you\r\nto choose that version for the Program.\r\n\r\n  Later license versions may give you additional or different\r\npermissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any\r\nauthor or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a\r\nlater version.\r\n\r\n  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.\r\n\r\n  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY\r\nAPPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT\r\nHOLDERS AND\/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY\r\nOF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,\r\nTHE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\r\nPURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM\r\nIS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF\r\nALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\r\n\r\n  16. Limitation of Liability.\r\n\r\n  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\r\nWILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND\/OR CONVEYS\r\nTHE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY\r\nGENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE\r\nUSE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF\r\nDATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD\r\nPARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),\r\nEVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF\r\nSUCH DAMAGES.\r\n\r\n  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.\r\n\r\n  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided\r\nabove cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,\r\nreviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates\r\nan absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the\r\nProgram, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a\r\ncopy of the Program in return for a fee.\r\n\r\n                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\r\n\r\n            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\r\n\r\n  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest\r\npossible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it\r\nfree software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\r\n\r\n  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest\r\nto attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\r\nstate the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least\r\nthe \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\r\n\r\n    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\r\n    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\r\n\r\n    This program is free software: you can redistribute it and\/or modify\r\n    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\r\n    the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or\r\n    (at your option) any later version.\r\n\r\n    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\r\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\r\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the\r\n    GNU General Public License for more details.\r\n\r\n    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License\r\n    along with this program.  If not, see <http:\/\/www.gnu.org\/licenses\/>.\r\n\r\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\r\n\r\n  If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short\r\nnotice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:\r\n\r\n    <program>  Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\r\n    This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.\r\n    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it\r\n    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.\r\n\r\nThe hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate\r\nparts of the General Public License.  Of course, your program's commands\r\nmight be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an \"about box\".\r\n\r\n  You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,\r\nif any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if necessary.\r\nFor more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see\r\n<http:\/\/www.gnu.org\/licenses\/>.\r\n\r\n  The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program\r\ninto proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you\r\nmay consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with\r\nthe library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General\r\nPublic License instead of this License.  But first, please read\r\n<http:\/\/www.gnu.org\/philosophy\/why-not-lgpl.html>.",

You may use content from this license document as source material for your own license agreement, but you may not use the name \"Hacktivismo Enhanced-Source Software License Agreement ,\" (\"HESSLA\") or any confusingly similar name, trademark or service-mark, in connection with any license agreement that is not either (1) a verbatim copy of this License Agreement, or (2) a license agreement that contains only additional terms expressly permitted by The HESSLA.\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTORY STATEMENT\r\n\r\nSoftware that Hacktivismo[fn1] releases under this License Agreement is intended to promote our political objectives. And, likewise, the purpose of this License Agreement itself is political: Namely, to compliment the software's intended political function. Hacktivismo itself exists to develop and deploy computer software technologies that promote fundamental human rights of end-users. Hacktivismo also seeks to enlist the active participation and involvement of people around the world, to help us improve these software tools, and to take other actions (including actions that involve using and distributing our software, and the advancement of similarly-minded software projects of others) that promote human rights and freedom worldwide.\r\n\r\n[fn1] http:\/\/hacktivismo.com\/\r\n\r\nBecause of our non-commercial objective of promoting end-users' freedoms, Hacktivismo has some special, and admittedly ambitious, licensing needs. This License Agreement enhances the benefits of published source code by backing up our human rights projects with appropriate remedies enforceable in court.\r\n\r\nThe Freedoms We Promote: When we speak of the freedom of end-users, we are talking about basic freedoms recognized in the Hacktivismo Declaration,[fn2] the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights,[fn3] the Universal Declaration of Human Rights,[fn4] and other documents that recognize and promote freedom and human dignity. Principal among these freedoms are:\r\n\r\n[fn2] http:\/\/hacktivismo.com\/about\/declarations\/\r\n\r\n[fn3] http:\/\/www.unhchr.ch\/html\/menu3\/b\/a_ccpr.htm\r\n\r\n[fn4] http:\/\/www.un.org\/Overview\/rights.html\r\n\r\nFreedom of Expression: The freedom of opinion and expression \"include[s] freedom to seek, receive and impart information and ideas of all kinds, regardless of frontiers,\"[fn5] and the freedom to choose one's own medium of expression. The arbitrary use of technological censorship measures to block or prevent access to broad categories of speech and expression including the work of critics, intellectuals, artists, journalists, and religious figures is seldom, if ever, justified by any legitimate governmental objective. And, to the extent that technology enables censorship decisions to be removed from public scrutiny and review, technology-based censorship mechanisms are especially suspect and dangerous to civil society. When repressive governments and other institutions of power seek to deprive people of this basic freedom, people have the right to secure, employ and deploy the tools necessary to reclaim the freedoms to which they are justifiably entitled.\r\n\r\n[fn5] Article 19, Universal Declaration of Human Rights.\r\n\r\nFreedom of Collective Action and Association: People have and should have the \"freedom of peaceful assembly and association.\"[fn6] This freedom includes the right of people to work together to secure constructive change in their personal, economic, and political circumstances. When repressive governments or other institutions of power seek to deprive people (including users of the Internet) of their freedoms of voluntary assembly, association, and common enterprise, people have the right to secure, employ and deploy technologies that reclaim the freedoms to which they are justifiably entitled.\r\n\r\n[fn6] Article 20(1), Universal Declaration of Human Rights.\r\n\r\nFreedoms of Thought, Conscience, Sexuality, and Religion: People have and should have the freedom of \"thought, conscience, and religion.\"[fn7] This right \"includes freedom to change religion or belief, and freedom, either alone or in community with others, in public or private, to manifest any religion or belief in teaching, practice, worship and observance, regardless of doctrine.\"[fn8] Every person, regardless of sex or sexual preference, and with reciprocal respect for the corresponding rights of all others, has and should have the right to determine and choose, freely and without coercion, whether, how and with whom he or she shall fully enjoy the most private and personal aspects of human life, including individual sexuality, reproduction, and fertility. Moreover, \"[t]he explicit recognition and reaffirmation of the right of all women to control all aspects of their health, in particular their own fertility, is basic to their empowerment.\"[fn9] When repressive governments and other institutions of power seek to deprive people of these basic freedoms, they have the right to secure, employ and deploy the tools necessary to reclaim the freedoms to which they are justifiably entitled.\r\n\r\n[fn7] Article 18, Universal Declaration of Human Rights.\r\n\r\n[fn8] Id.\r\n\r\n[fn9] Paragraph 17, Beijing Declaration of the Fourth United Nations Conference on Women (Sept. 15, 1995).\r\n\r\nFreedom of Privacy: Every person has the right to be free from \"subject[ion] to arbitrary interference with his [or her] privacy, family, home or correspondence\"[fn10] -- digitally, or by any other means or methodology. This freedom of privacy includes the right to be free from governmental or private surveillance that might interfere with or deter the rightful exercise of any other freedoms of any person. In the context of software tools that enable people to reclaim their freedoms, all end-users have and should have the right to secure and use tools that are free from the surreptitious insertion into their software of \"backdoors,\" \"spy-ware,\" escrow mechanisms, or other code or techniques that might promote surveillance, or subvert security (including cryptographic security), confidentiality, anonymity, authenticity and\/or trust.\r\n\r\n[fn10] Article 12, Universal Declaration of Human Rights.\r\n\r\nReasons For Enhancing \"Free\" and \"Open-Source\" Licensing: Developing a new software license is never a trivial task and this License Agreement has presented special challenges for Hacktivismo. Because of our human rights objectives, this License Agreement includes some specific terms and conditions that, as a technical matter, depart from the previously-recognized and established definitions of \"free\"[fn11] software and \"open source\"[fn12] software.\r\n\r\n[fn11] http:\/\/www.gnu.org\/philosophy\/free-sw.html\r\n\r\n[fn12] http:\/\/www.opensource.org\/docs\/definition_plain.php\r\n\r\nWe have therefore coined the term \"enhanced source\" to describe this License Agreement because we have sought to combine most of the freedom-promoting benefits of \"free\" or \"open-source\" software (including mandatory disclosure of any changes or modifications Licensees make to the source code, whenever they release modified versions of HESSLA-licensed Programs or other Derivative Works), with additional enhanced license and contractual terms that are intended to promote the freedom of end-users. The Hacktivismo Enhanced-Source Software License Agreement promotes our objectives in an enhanced manner by including contractual terms that empower both Hacktivismo and qualified end-users with greater flexibility and leverage to maintain and recover human rights, through the mechanism of the contract itself including terms that are designed to enhance both our enforcement posture and that of qualified end-users in court.\r\n\r\nTo be sure, Hacktivismo enthusiastically endorses and supports the goals and objectives of the Free Software movement and those of the open source community. In particular, we owe a special debt of gratitude to the Free Software Foundation, to the Open Source Initiative, and to many exceedingly talented people who have contributed to Free Software and open source projects and endeavors over the years.\r\n\r\nUltimately, however, after reviewing the field of possibilities among previously-existing \"open source\" and \"free\" licenses, Hacktivismo has concluded that none of them fully meets our requirements. Writing our own License Agreement enables us to pursue our human rights objectives more effectively. This licensing endeavor represents a first step toward achieving our objectives, and no doubt informed feedback, scholarship, and learned commentary will enable us to pursue our objectives even more effectively in the future.\r\n\r\nBenefits That Carry Over From Free Software: Before we explain how an \"enhanced source\" License Agreement specifically differs from a \"free\" or \"open source\" license, we believe it is helpful to explain in greater detail what the principal advantages, and freedom-enhancing aspects, of \"free\" software are.\r\n\r\nWhen we speak of \"free software,\" we refer to important personal freedoms, and not price. In addition to terms that are intended to promote the freedoms of Expression, Thought, Collective Action and Privacy (along with other human rights) of all end-users, the Hacktivismo Enhanced-Source Software License Agreement is also designed and intended to promote the following freedoms:\r\n\r\n\u00b7\tYou have the freedom to distribute copies of the software (and charge for this service if You wish);\r\n\r\n\u00b7\tYou have the freedom of access to the source code, to inspect and verify (and even to improve, if You can) the integrity and functionality of the software;\r\n\r\n\u00b7\tSo long as You do not subvert or infringe the freedoms of end-users by doing so, You have the freedom to change the software or to use parts of it in new Programs;\r\n\r\n\u00b7\tYou have the freedom to know You can do these things.\r\n\r\nThe licenses for most computer software programs are designed to take away Your freedom to share software or change source code. This kind of software is designated as proprietary or \"closed.\" The Hacktivismo Enhanced-Source Software License Agreement -- like other license agreements that have served as inspiration for our work -- is intended to promote both Your freedom to share our software with others, and Your freedom to change and improve the software. Your right under this License Agreement to look at the source not only enables You to contribute Your own efforts to Hacktivismo's human rights projects, but also serves as an additional level of assurance to You as an end-user that unwelcome, hidden surprises have not been inserted into the software, that could compromise Your rights and freedoms when You use the software.\r\n\r\nHESSLA Helps Safeguard Additional End-User Freedoms: In order to understand why this License Agreement must be described as \"enhanced source,\" and cannot strictly speaking be considered either a \"free\" or \"open source\" license agreement, it is helpful to consider the possibility that a programmer might insert malicious code, such as a computer virus, a keystroke logger, or \"spyware\" into a program that has previously been released under a \"free software\" license agreement.[fn13] The act of inserting malicious code into software, if done by a private individual or company (though many governments will contend they are not required to play by the same rules as the rest of us), may well violate criminal laws and result in civil tort liability. It is, of course, also possible to deter such malicious behavior by including, in a software license agreement, a specific contractual term that prohibits such behavior meaning that any licensee who violates the prohibition against malicious code can be sued by the licensor (or by third-party beneficiaries who the licensor has explicitly identified as alternate or additional enforcers of the agreement) for money damages and a court order forbidding any continued violation.\r\n\r\n[fn13]In this regard, a the following hypothetical illustration should be particularly helpful. If an organization of computer security enthusiasts were to release, under the GNU General Public License (\"GPL\"), a program called \"Grey Eminence 3000\" (\"GE3K\") a remote-administration tool for Microsoft Windows, that helps illustrate how insecure this particular commercial product happens to be it should hardly be surprising that the United States Secret Service and Federal Bureau of Investigation, after making some loud and misleading apocalyptic noises about \"computer hackers\" to Congress and in the media (primarily in a largely successful effort to increase their technology budgets), would also study the software to see what it does, how it does it, and whether any of those capabilities happen to be features that law enforcement might find helpful. Of course, if the U.S. federal law enforcement community were to announce, several months later, that it had commissioned the development of \"classified\" quasi-viral computer-intrusion and surveillance software called \"Magic Candle\" the capabilities of which law enforcement does not plan to disclose to the public, and the source code for which will remain a closely-guarded secret then inquiring minds might become curious as to whether \"Magic Candle\" contains any of the GPLed code that was written for \"GE3K\" (or any other free or open-source software, for that matter). Needless to say, under the right factual circumstances, if any GPLed code from GE3K found its way into \"Magic Candle,\" then the U.S. government or its software development contractor might well be obligated to reveal to the public all the source code for \"Magic Candle.\" Nevertheless, so long as the \"Magic Candle\" source is never publicly released for comparison purposes, then everyone with legitimate questions about GPL compliance faces a chicken-and-egg problem. So long as the source of \"Magic Candle\" remains secret, detection of a GPL violation becomes dramatically more difficult (particularly so if, additionally, nobody outside law enforcement has access to the compiled executables), which means the worldwide community of Internet users and software developers has only the United States government's solemn assurance that no GE3K code was used cold comfort at best.\r\n\r\nPrevious Licenses Provide More Limited Protection Against Government and Other Surveillance: No software license agreement that qualifies as \"free\" or \"open source\" may contain any restriction as a term of the license agreement that in any way qualifies any Licensee's prerogative (no matter who they are or what their motives may be) to make changes to code. In other words, an \"open source\" license agreement, to qualify for the \"open source\" label, may not even contain a term that prohibits the insertion of destructive viruses or \"trojan horses\" into derivative code. Likewise, no \"free\" or \"open source\" license agreement can in any way contain (as a license term) any restriction on the use of software not even a prohibition against unlawful surveillance or other malicious uses of the software.\r\n\r\nThe \"open source\" and \"Free Software\" communities rely principally on voluntary compliance[fn14] with the disclosure provisions of license agreements (although many \"free\" and \"open source\" license agreements, such as BSD-style licenses, do not require changed code to be disclosed, and in fact enable modified versions of programs to be \"taken proprietary\") and on social mechanisms of enforcement, as means to detect, prevent, deter, and remedy abuses.\r\n\r\n[fn14]As the example in Note 13 illustrates, it is sometimes difficult to determine whether the source disclosure requirement of the GPL has been violated, such as when a modified version of a program has been distributed without source, precisely because detection of a disclosure violation depends in part on the disclosure of the source of derivative works in order to compare whether a putative derivative really does contain code derived from a GPLed parent work.\r\n\r\nThe Hacktivismo Enhanced-Source Software License Agreement does not in any way sacrifice or surrender the enforcement techniques and safeguards available under license agreements such as the GNU General Public License. Rather, the HESSLA enhances the options available to Hacktivismo and to qualified end-users, by providing additional enforcement options. Moreover, for the purpose of promoting the freedoms of both programers and end-users, through the enforced mandatory disclosure of code modified by third-parties, this License Agreement has advantages over many of the licenses (such as BSD-style licenses) that fully qualify as \"free\" or \"open-source\" license agreements.\r\n\r\nWhat makes this License Agreement an \"enhanced source\" License Agreement, instead of a \"free software\" license agreement, is that the Hacktivismo Enhanced-Source Software License Agreement contains specific, very limited restrictions on modification and use of software by Licensees, as part of a calculated trade-off of rights and responsibilities that is intended to promote the freedom of end-users.\r\n\r\nThe Enhanced-Source Bargain Reinforces End-User Freedoms: To protect Your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny You specific rights or to ask You to surrender these rights. To protect Your human rights as an end-user of this program or any work based on it, we need to make restrictions that forbid You and all other Licensees of this software (including, without limitation, any government Licensees) from using this code to subvert the human rights of any end-user.\r\n\r\nWe protect Your rights and the rights of all end-users with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2) offer You this License Agreement which gives You qualified legal permission to copy, distribute and\/or modify the software.\r\n\r\nThe restrictions shared by all Licensees translate into certain responsibilities for You and for everyone else (including governmental entities everywhere) if You distribute copies of the software, if You use it, or if You modify it.\r\n\r\nIn this regard, the methodology we employ is not materially different from the methodology Free Software Foundation employs in the GNU General Public License (the \"GPL\"). The methodology is to exchange the Author's permission to copy, change, and\/or distribute a copyrighted work, for every Licensee's acceptance of terms and conditions that promote the licensor's objectives. In both this License Agreement and the GPL, the terms and conditions that each Licensee must accept are intended to discriminate against certain very narrow, limited kinds of human endeavor, that are inconsistent with the licensor's political objectives. In other words, the GPL requires each Licensee to promise not to engage in the activity of 'propertizing,' or 'taking proprietary,' modifications to GPLed code; modified code must also be released under the GPL, and cannot be released in the form of \"closed\" executables, or otherwise be made \"proprietary.\" Likewise, the Hacktivismo Enhanced Source Software License Agreement discriminates against undesirable activity such as surveillance, introduction of certain kinds of malicious code, and human rights violations, as well as discriminating against \"propertizing\" behavior such as might violate the GPL. Subject to these narrow restrictions, Licensees under either license agreement enjoy very broad latitude to change, use, explore, modify, and distribute the software much broader than they would enjoy with typical \"proprietary\" software packages.\r\n\r\nAs with \"copyleft\" licenses such as the GPL, under the Hacktivismo Enhanced Source Software License Agreement, programmers (including, most importantly, programmers working for governments) do not have unfettered or completely unlimited \"freedom\" for purposes of what they can do with HESSLA-licensed code. Just as with the GPL, they do not have the \"freedom\" to convert HESSLA-licensed code into \"closed\" or \"proprietary\" code. People who create derivative works based on an HESSLA-licensed program and distribute those works have a corresponding obligation to \"give back,\" and not merely to \"take,\" HESSLA-licensed code.\r\n\r\nIf You distribute copies of such an HESSLA-licensed program, whether gratis or for a fee, You must give the recipients all the rights and responsibilities that You have. You must ensure that they, too, are told of the terms of this License Agreement, including the freedoms they have, and the kinds of uses and modifications that are forbidden. You must communicate a copy of this License Agreement to them as part of any copy, modification, or re-use of source or object code, so they know their rights and responsibilities.\r\n\r\nThus, the main difference between this License Agreement and the GPL is not the methodology we employ,[fn15] but the scope and breadth of the political objectives we seek to promote. Simply put, the political objectives we promote are somewhat broader than the explicit political goals that the Free Software Foundation seeks to promote through the GPL. Our goals include a somewhat broader range of human rights than the specific copyright-related rights with which the GPL is principally concerned. But, while we are concerned with the entire field of human rights rather than a subset, we want to make it perfectly clear that we also embrace, share, and seek to promote, the goals we share with the Free Software movement.\r\n\r\n[fn15] There is a modest difference, but it is not large, and mostly philosophical. Some experts on the GPL draw a distinction between a \"contract\" and a pure \"license,\" by taking the position that a pure \"license\" does not impose \"contractual\" conditions on a Licensee only conditions that would otherwise (but for the license) be subsumed within with exclusive rights that the licensor has under copyright law. Thus, the licensor has the right to exclude anyone else from such activities as making copies, making derivative works, publicly performing a work, and other exclusive rights specified by statute. But, concerning the act of \"using\" a computer software program, in instances in which a copy is not made (or, in the trivial sense that a copy is made only temporarily from a storage medium to memory, to enable software to be \"used\"), the Free Software Foundation takes the position that United States law, at least, does not confer an exclusive right on the copyright holder (or, as others would argue, the United States statute qualifies the holder's exclusive right to copy),because the U.S. Copyright Act specifically exempts from the exclusive right to make copies, a copy made from (for example) a computer hard drive to volatile memory, in connection with the process of executing computer software. So far as we can determine, the Free Software Foundation does not argue that it is impossible \"contractually\" to impose conditions on use, as part of the bargain one strikes, when conditionally allowing Licensees to make copies of a program. Rather, for philosophical reasons, the Free Software Foundation voluntarily chooses not to include what it views as \"contractual\" conditions in the GPL. In this sense, Hactivismo takes the position that the HESSLA is clearly a \"contract\" and contains \"contractual\" terms, such that it should not be considered a \"pure license,\" under the nomenclature employed by the Free Software Foundation. However, in our view, precisely because both the HESSLA and the GPL are clearly conditional grants of permission to do things from which the Licensee would otherwise be excluded (i.e., the Licensee must undertake certain obligations in exchange for permission to copy, modify, or distribute, a work), the key point is that the methodology is quite similar.\r\n\r\nCompared with the GPL, aspects of the HESSLA give both end-users and programmers (including, most importantly, governmental end-users and programmers) marginally less leeway to make malicious use of the program, or to insert malicious code into a program, than they would have under a traditional \"copyleft\" software license. These aspects of the HESSLA (such as the requirement that the program cannot be used to violate human rights, or forbidding the insertion of \"spy-ware\" or surveillance mechanisms into derivative works) are included because our ultimate objective is to preserve and promote the human rights of end-users, including their privacy and their right of free expression.\r\n\r\nIn other words, unlike many programmers, we are not just in the business of developing and distributing open-standards technologies. We're also trying to empower end-users (including end-users in totalitarian regimes) with software tools that promote fundamental freedoms while also seeking as best we can to protect these end-users from being arrested, beaten, or worse. Our objective of promoting end-user freedoms, including the freedoms of people in politically repressive countries, is precisely the factor that has led Hacktivismo to develop this License Agreement instead of using another.\r\n\r\nThe HESSLA Also Includes Features To Enhance Government Accountability: To this end, we have sought and intend to ensure, to the fullest extent that law (including, without limitation, the law of contract and of copyright licensing) enables us to do so,[fn16] that no government or other institution may do anything with this computer software or the underlying source code without becoming a Licensee bound by the terms of this License Agreement, subject to the same restrictions on modification and use as anyone else.\r\n\r\n[fn16] \"Everyone has the right to an effective remedy by the competent national tribunals for acts violating . . . fundamental rights . . .\" Article 8, United Nations Declaration of Human Rights.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, this License Agreement includes several terms that are aimed explicitly at governmental entities, in order to maximize enforceability against such entities. Respect for the Rule of Law means that no governmental entity is above the law, and that no governmental entity should be permitted to use its status as a mechanism for circumventing the requirements of this License Agreement.\r\n\r\nAny use, copying or modification of this software by any governmental official or governmental entity anywhere in the world is a voluntary act, which act the governmental official or entity is free to forego if it does not wish to be bound by this License Agreement. This License Agreement seeks to establish as clearly as possible two important checks on the improper use of government power. First, the voluntary election to use, copy, or modify, this software by any government or governmental official constitutes a waiver of all immunities that might otherwise be asserted, against enforcement of this License Agreement by the Author, or assertion by end-users or others of any human rights laws that may have been violated by a government employing the Software. Second, any such government or governmental official not only subjects itself to enforcement action in its own courts, but also explicitly and voluntarily subjects itself to enforcement action in the courts of other nations that are likely to be more objective, for the purpose of giving effect to the terms of this License Agreement.\r\n\r\nMechanism of Contract Acceptance: This License Agreement treats any use of the software as acceptance of the terms of this License Agreement. To understand the significance of this, it is important to distinguish between the law governing copyright and the law governing offer and acceptance for the purpose of contract formation (which gives the offeror the power to specify the manner of acceptance). The question of whether copyright confers an exclusive right of use on the author of a program is certainly an interesting one. Under United States law, see 17 U.S.C. \u0015 117(a)(1), a limited exception to the exclusive right to copy exists if one makes a second copy \"created as an essential step in the utilization of the computer program in conjunction with a machine and that it is used in no other manner.\" This License Agreement presupposes that there is no exclusive right to use in the Copyright Act, just an exclusive right to copy. However, You may not make a copy for anyone else unless they are subject to the terms of this License Agreement. Nor may You permit anyone to use Your copy or any other copy You have made unless they are subject to the terms of this License Agreement. You may not make a copy for Your own use or the use of anyone else without the Author's leave to make that copy. And any use, modification, copying, or distribution by anyone constitutes acceptance of the License Agreement, for purposes of contract law. In other words, the License Agreement is designed so that there is no loophole permitting anyone to claim the ability to use, copy, distribute, or modify the Program or any Software based on it without subjecting themselves voluntarily to its terms.\r\n\r\nOn \"Shrinkwrap,\" \"Click-Wrap,\" \"Use-Wrap\" and \"Copy-Wrap\" License Agreements: Arguably, some kinds of software license agreements have more in common with legislation than they do with the bargained-for, negotiated agreements that come to mind when most people think of \"contracts.\" Particularly if a software licensor has sufficient market power to be deemed a monopoly, or if certain proposed expansions of the law of software licensing, masquerading as \"codifications,\" are widely adopted, the ability of a private entity to impose legal prohibitions and duties on virtually everyone else as though the licensor has assumed powers that customarily belong to legislative bodies is both breathtaking and deeply troubling. Of course, we are hardly the first to distribute software under a license agreement that imposes conditions on a take-it-or-leave-it basis. This technique is, as everyone knows, extremely common with proprietary software. And some of the conditions unilaterally imposed by proprietary licensors range from the ridiculous to the obscene. But even certain kinds of \"free\" and \"open-source\" software licenses, such as the GPL, depend on the continued viability of legal rules that enable at least some reasonable conditions to be imposed by software licensors on a take-it-or-leave-it basis, with essentially automated methods of acceptance. Courts have been divided as to how far these kinds of licensor-driven automated agreements can go. And we cannot say that we will be unhappy if courts or legislatures ultimately reach a consensus that sharply limits what conditions licensors can impose through such mechanisms. However, while the law is still developing, we think nothing could be more appropriate than to enlist the techniques that institutions of power have used to limit freedom and instead to re-purpose the techniques of \"copy-wrap\" or \"use-wrap\" licensing by putting them to use for humanitarian purposes and using them to promote the human rights of end-users. To deny us the use of these techniques, courts and other law-making institutions would be required simultaneously to disarm, to the same degree, proprietary software manufacturers that possess vast market power. And, unlike the conditions imposed by many proprietary vendors, the conditions we impose through this License Agreement are hardly onerous for any end-user (unless, of course, the end-user wants to act maliciously or engage in surveillance).\r\n\r\nNo Warranty: Next, for each author's protection and our own, we want to make certain that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this software. And, if the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original authors' reputations.\r\n\r\nSoftware Patents: Software patents constantly threaten any project such as this one. We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a HESSLA-licensed program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program proprietary. To prevent this, we have included terms by which any Author must, if it has patented (or licensed a patent covering) any technology embodied in any Program or Software released under this License Agreement, grant all HESSLA Licensees of the Program or Software a royalty-free license of that technology. Any Licensees who release derivative works, as permitted by this License Agreement, are required to grant a royalty-free patent license of any patented technology.\r\n\r\nAnyone Can Release Original Software Under The HESSLA: Although this License Agreement is drafted with Hacktivismo's objectives in mind, perhaps it will meet other authors' needs as well. If You are considering using this License Agreement for Your own software (meaning the code is not a work based on Hacktivismo's program in which case all derivative works must be released under this License Agreement but rather Your code is original software that You have developed yourself) and if You have no special reason to prefer this License Agreement to some license that has a more robust and widely-understood track-record, then in most instances we encourage You to use the GPL (or, even better, release concurrently under both the HESSLA and the GPL), because a considerable body of interpretive literature and community custom has grown up around that License Agreement. The Open Software License, see < http:\/\/www.rosenlaw.com\/osl.html >, is newer and has less of a track record. But You may also want to consider that licensing option (as well as the option of concurrent OSL\/HESSLA licensing).\r\n\r\nAny author of original software can release that software under this License Agreement, if You choose to do so; not just Hacktivismo. Hacktivismo is the author and owner of software released by Hacktivismo under this License Agreement. But original software released by other Authors would be owned and licensed by them.\r\n\r\nUltimately, we think it is important to emphasize to other Authors that Programs they have written can be released under both the HESSLA and some other license simultaneously (for, example, a program that is presently GPLed by its Author can be released simultaneously under both the GPL and the HESSLA, at the Author's discretion). If You are an Author of original work, You need neither the permission of the Free Software Foundation nor of Hacktivismo to elect to release software simultaneously under both licenses. The advantage of such a voluntary double-licensing is that it will enable developers to produce hybrid software packages (combining the functionality available through, say, Hacktivismo's Six-Four APIs, with some of the functionality of one or more popular GPL-licensed communications programs) and to release the hybrid packages under the HESSLA, without causing those developers to run afoul of the GPL, the HESSLA or both. Such an arrangement maximizes the potential benefit to both the developer community and to end-users worldwide. Software released under a BSD-style license, as a general matter, can be used to produce a hybrid program, mixing HESSLA-licensed code with code that was previously subject to a BSD license. The HESSLA requires that, in such an instance, the hybrid code must be released under the HESSLA (to avoid weakening the end-user protections and affirmative rights afforded by the HESSLA). Hacktivismo is more than happy to consult with any software developer about the license terms that should apply to any Software that is derivative of any Program of which Hacktivismo is Author. If another Author has released code under the HESSLA, then that Author has primary decision-making authority about the manner in which his her or its software is licensed, but Hacktivismo is happy to field any questions hat may be posed by such an Author or by any developer who is building on another Author's HESSLAed code.\r\n\r\nLicense Revisions: This License Agreement is subject to revision, prior to the release of the Hacktivismo Enhanced-Source Software License Agreement, Version 1.0. We invite interested parties from the international academic and legal communities to offer comments and suggestions on ways to improve this License Agreement, prior to the time that The HESSLA version 1.0 is released.\r\n\r\nThe terms of the latest and most up-to-date version of this License Agreement, up to and including version 1.0, shall be deemed automatically to supersede the terms of any lower-numbered version of this License Agreement with respect to any Licensee who became a Licensee under the lower-numbered version of the HESSLA.\r\n\r\nThe terms of the latest and most up-to-date version of this License Agreement will always be published on the Hacktivismo Website, http:\/\/www.hacktivismo.com\/.\r\n\r\nThe precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution, use and modification follow.\r\n\r\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION, USE AND\/OR MODIFICATION\r\n\r\n0. DEFINITIONS. The following are defined terms that, whenever used in this License Agreement, have the following meanings:\r\n\r\n0.1\tAuthor: \"Author\" shall mean the copyright holder of an Original Work (the \"Program\") released by the Author under this License Agreement.\r\n\r\n0.2\tCopy: \"Copy\" shall mean everything and anything that constitutes a copy according to copyright law, without limitation. A \"copy\" does not become anything other than a \"copy\" merely because, for example, a governmental or institutional employee duplicates the Program or a part of it for another employee of the same institution or Governmental Entity, or merely because it is copied from one computer to another, or from one medium to another, or multiple copies are made on the same medium, within the same institutional or Governmental Entity.\r\n\r\n0.3\tDerivative Work: A \"Derivative Work\" or \"work based on the Program\" shall mean either the Program itself or any work containing the Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and\/or translated into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term \"modification.\"). In the unlikely event that, and to the extent that, this contractual definition of \"Derivative Work\" is later determined by any tribunal or dispute-resolution body to be different is scope from the meaning of \"derivative work\" under the copyright law of any country, then the broadest and most encompassing possible definition either the contractual definition of \"Derivative Work,\" or any broader and more encompassing statutory or legal definition, shall control. Acceptance of this contractually-defined scope of the term \"Derivative Work\" is a mandatory pre-condition for You to receive any of the benefits offered by this License Agreement.\r\n\r\n0.3.1\tMere aggregation of another work not based on the Program with the Program (or with a Derivative Work based on the Program) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this License Agreement.\r\n\r\n0.4\tLicense Agreement: When used in this License Agreement, the terms \"this License\" or \"this License Agreement\" shall mean The Hactivismo Enhanced-Source Software License Agreement, v. 0.1, or any subsequent version made applicable under the terms of Section 15.\r\n\r\n0.5\tLicensee: The term \"Licensee\" shall mean You or any other Licensee, whether or not a Qualified Licensee.\r\n\r\n0.6\tOriginal Work: \"Original Work\" shall mean a Program or other work of authorship, or portion thereof, that is not a Derivative Work.\r\n\r\n0.7\tProgram: The \"Program,\" to which this License Agreement applies, is the Original Work (including, but not limited to, computer software) released by the Author under this License Agreement.\r\n\r\n0.8\tQualified Licensee: A \"Qualified Licensee\" means a Licensee that remains in full compliance with all terms and conditions of this License Agreement. You are no longer a Qualified Licensee if, at any time, You violate any terms of this License Agreement. Neither the Program nor any Software based on the Program may be copied, distributed, performed, displayed, used or modified by You, even for Your own purposes, unless You are a Qualified Licensee. A Licensee other than a Qualified Licensee remains subject to all terms and conditions of this License Agreement, and to all remedies for each cumulative violation as set forth herein. Loss of the status of Qualified Licensee signifies that violation of any terms of the License Agreement subjects a Licensee to loss of most of the benefits that Qualified Licensees enjoy under this License Agreement, and to additional remedies for all violations occurring after the first violation.\r\n\r\n0.9\tSoftware: \"Software\" or \"the Software\" shall mean the Program, any Derivative Work based on the Program or a portion thereof, and\/or any modified version of the Program or portion thereof, without limitation.\r\n\r\n0.10\tSource Code: The term \"Source Code\" shall mean the preferred form of a Program or Original Work for making modifications to it and all available documentation describing how to access and modify that Program or Original Work.\r\n\r\n0.10.1\tFor an executable work, complete Source Code means all the Source Code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the executable. However, as a special exception, the Source Code distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable.\r\n\r\n0.10.2\t\"Object Code:\" Because of certain peculiarities of current export-control rules, \"object code\" of the Program, or any modified version of the Program, or Derivative Work based on the Program, must not be exported except by way of distribution that is ancillary to the distribution of the Source Code. The \"Source Code\" shall be understood as the primary content transferred or exported by You, and the \"object code\" shall be considered as merely an ancillary component of any such export distribution.\r\n\r\n0.11\tStrong Cryptography: \"Strong Cryptography\" shall mean cryptography no less secure than (for example, and without limitation) a 2048-bit minimum key size for RSA encryption, 1024-bit minimum key size for Diffie-Hellman (El Gamal), or a 256-bit minimum key size for AES and similar symmetric ciphers.\r\n\r\n0.12\tSubstandard Key-Selection Technique: The term \"Substandard Key-Selection Technique\" shall mean a method or technique to cause encryption keys to be more easily guessed or less secure, such as by (i) causing the selection of keys to be less than random, or (ii) employing a selection process that selects among only a subset of possible keys, instead of from among the largest set of possible keys that can securely be used consistent with contemporary knowledge about the cryptographic techniques employed by You. The following illustrations elaborate on the foregoing definition:\r\n\r\n0.12.1\tIf the key-generation or key-selection technique for the encryption algorithm You employ involves the selection of one or more prime numbers, or involves one or more mathematical functions or concatenations performed on one or more prime numbers, then each prime number should be selected from a very large set of candidate prime numbers, but not necessarily from the set of all possible prime numbers (e.g., inclusion of the number 1 in the candidate set, for example, may in some instances reduce rather than enhance security), and absolutely not from any artificially small set of candidate primes that makes the guessing of a key easier than would be the case if a secure key-generation technique were employed. In all instances, the primes should be selected at random from among the candidate set. If there is a customary industry standard for maximizing the security associated with the key-generation or key-selection technique for the cryptosystem You select, then (with attention also to the requirements of Section 0.11), You should employ a key-generation or selection technique no less secure than the customary industry standard for secure use of the cryptosystem.\r\n\r\n0.12.2\tIf the key-generation or key-selection technique for the encryption algorithm You employ involves the selection of a random integer, or the transformation of a random integer through one or more mathematical processes, then the selection of the integer shall be at random from the largest possible set of all possible integers consistent with the secure functioning of the encryption algorithm. It shall not be selected from an artificially small set of integers (e.g., if a 256-bit random integer serves as the key, then You could not set 200 of the 256 bits as \"0,\" and randomly generate only the remaining 56 bits producing effectively a 56-bit keylength instead of using the full 256 bits).\r\n\r\n0.12.3\tIn other words, Your key-generation technique must promote security to the maximum extent permitted by the cryptographic method(s) and keylength You elect to employ, rather than facilitating eavesdropping or surveillance in any way. The example of GSM telephones, in which 16 of 56 bits in each encryption key were set at \"0,\" thereby reducing the security of the system by a factor of 65,536, is particularly salient. Such artificial techniques to reduce the security of a cryptosystem by selecting keys from only a less-secure or suboptimal subset of possible keys, is prohibited and will violate this License Agreement if any such technique is employed in any Software.\r\n\r\n0.13\tYou:\tEach Licensee (including, without limitation, Licensees that have violated the License Agreement and who are no longer Qualified Licensees, but who nevertheless remain subject to all requirements of this License Agreement and to all cumulative remedies for each successive violation), is referred to as \"You.\"\r\n\r\n0.13.1\tGovernmental Entity: \"You\" explicitly includes any and all \"Governmental Entities,\" without limitation. \"Governmental Entity\" or \"Governmental Entities,\" when used in this License Agreement, shall mean national governments, sub-national governments (for example, and without limitation, provincial, state, regional, local and municipal governments, autonomous governing units, special districts, and other such entities), governmental subunits (without limitation, governmental agencies, offices, departments, government corporations, and the like), supra-national governmental entities such as the European Union, and entities through which one or more governments perform governmental functions or exercise governmental power in coordination, cooperation or unison.\r\n\r\n0.13.2\tGovernmental Person: \"You\" also explicitly includes \"Governmental Persons.\" The terms \"Governmental Person\" or \"Governmental Persons,\" when used in this License Agreement, shall mean the officials, officers, employees, representatives, contractors and agents of any Governmental Entity.\r\n\r\n1.\tApplication of License Agreement. This License Agreement applies to any Program or other Original Work of authorship that contains a notice placed by the Author saying it may be distributed under the terms of this License Agreement. The preferred manner of placing such a notice is to include the following statement immediately after the copyright notice for such an Original Work:\r\n\r\n\"Licensed under the Hacktivismo Enhanced-Source Software License Agreement, Version 0.1\"\r\n\r\n2.\tMeans of Acceptance Use, Copying, Distribution or Modification By Anyone Constitutes Acceptance. Subject to Section 14.1 (concerning the special case of certain Governmental Entities) any copying, modification, distribution, or use by You of the Program or any Software, shall constitute Your acceptance of all terms and conditions of this License Agreement.\r\n\r\n2.1\tAs a Licensee, You may not authorize, permit, or enable any person to use the Program or any Software or Derivative Work based on it (including any use of Your copy or copies of the Program) unless such person has accepted this License Agreement and has become a Licensee subject to all its terms and conditions.\r\n\r\n2.2\tYou may not make any copy for Your own use unless You have accepted this License Agreement and subjected yourself to all its terms and conditions.\r\n\r\n2.3\tYou may not make a copy for the use of any other person, or transfer a copy to any other person, unless such person is a Licensee that has accepted this License Agreement and such person is subject to all terms and conditions of this License Agreement.\r\n\r\n2.4\tIt is not the position of Hacktivismo that copyright law confers an exclusive right to use, as opposed to the exclusive right to copy the Software. However, for purposes of contract law, any use of the Software shall be considered to constitute acceptance of this License Agreement. Moreover, all copying is prohibited unless the recipient of a copy has accepted the License Agreement. Because each such recipient Licensee is contractually obligated not to permit anyone to access, use, or secure a copy of the Software, without first accepting the terms and conditions of this License Agreement, use by non-Licensees is effectively prohibited contractually because nobody can obtain a copy of, or access to a copy of, any Software without (1) accepting the License Agreement through use, and (2) triggering some Licensee's obligation to require acceptance as a precondition of copying or access.\r\n\r\n3.\t\"Qualified Licensee\" Requirement: Neither the Program nor any Software or Derivative Work based on the Program may be copied, distributed, displayed, performed, used or modified by You, even for Your own purposes, unless You are a \"Qualified Licensee.\" To remain a Qualified Licensee, You must remain in full compliance with all terms and conditions of this License Agreement.\r\n\r\n4.\tLicense Agreement Is Exclusive Source of All Your Rights:\r\n\r\n4.1\tYou may not copy, modify, or distribute the Program, or obtain any copy, except as expressly provided under this License Agreement. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, obtain a copy, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will automatically terminate Your rights under this License Agreement and subject You to all cumulative remedies for each successive violation that may be available to the Author. However, Qualified Licensees who have received copies from You (and thereby have received rights from the Author) under this License Agreement, and who would otherwise qualify as Qualified Licensees, will not have their rights under their License Agreements suspended or restricted on account of anything You do, so long as such parties remain in full compliance.\r\n\r\n4.2 You are not required to accept this License Agreement and prior to the time You elect to become a Licensee and accept this License Agreement, You may always elect instead not to copy, use, modify, distribute, compile, or perform the Program or any Software released under this License Agreement. However, nothing else grants You permission to copy, to obtain or possess a copy, to compile a copy in object code or executable code from a copy in source code, to modify, or to distribute the Program or any Software based on the Program. These actions are prohibited by law if You do not accept this License Agreement. Additionally, as set forth in Section 2, any use, copying or modification of the Software constitutes acceptance of this License Agreement by You.\r\n\r\n4.3 Each time You redistribute the Program (or any Software or Derivative Work based on the Program), the recipient automatically receives a License Agreement from the Author to copy, distribute, modify, perform or display the Software, subject to the terms and conditions of this License Agreement. You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License Agreement. Enforcement is the responsibility of the Author.\r\n\r\n5.\tGrant of Source Code License.\r\n\r\n5.1\tSource Code Always Available from Author: Author hereby promises and agrees except to the extent prohibited by export-control law to provide a machine-readable copy of the Source Code of the Program at the request of any Licensee. Author reserves the right to satisfy this obligation by placing a machine-readable copy of the Source Code of the most current version of the Program in an information repository reasonably calculated to permit inexpensive and convenient access by You for so long as Author continues to distribute the Program, and by publishing the address of that information repository in a notice immediately following the copyright notice that applies to the Program. Every copy of the Program distributed by Hacktivismo (but not necessarily every other Author) consists of the Source Code accompanied, in some instances, by an ancillary distribution of compiled Object Code, but the continued availability of the Source Code from the Author addresses the possibility that You might have (for any reason) not received from someone else a complete, current, copy of the Source Code (lack of which would, for example, prevent You from exporting copies to others without violating this license, see Section 8).\r\n\r\n5.2\tGrant of License. If and only if, and for so long as You remain a Qualified Licensee, in accordance with Section 3 of this License Agreement, Author hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, non-sublicensable copyright license to do the following:\r\n\r\n5.2.1 to reproduce the Source Code of the Program in copies;\r\n\r\n5.2.2\tto prepare Derivative Works based upon the Program and to edit or modify the Source Code in the process of preparing such Derivative Works;\r\n\r\n5.2.3\tto distribute copies of the Source Code of the Original Work and\/or of Derivative Works to others, with the proviso that copies of Original Work or Derivative Works that You distribute shall be licensed under this License Agreement, and that You shall fully inform all recipients of the terms of this License Agreement.\r\n\r\n6.\tGrant of Copyright License. If and only if, and for so long as You remain a Qualified Licensee, in accordance with Section 3 of this License Agreement, Author hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, non-sublicensable license to do the following:\r\n\r\n6.1 to reproduce the Program in copies;\r\n\r\n6.2\tto prepare Derivative Works based upon the Program, or upon Software that itself is based on the Program;\r\n\r\n6.3\tto distribute (either by distributing the Source Code, or by distributing compiled Object Code, but any export of Object Code must be ancillary to a distribution of Source Code) copies of the Program and Derivative Works to others, with the proviso that copies of the Program or Derivative Works that You distribute shall be licensed under this License Agreement, that You shall fully inform all recipients of the terms of this License Agreement;\r\n\r\n6.4 to perform the Program or a Derivative Work publicly;\r\n\r\n6.5\tto display the Program or a Derivative Work publicly; and\r\n\r\n6.6\tto charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy of the Program (You may also, at Your option, offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee).\r\n\r\n7.\tGrant of Patent License. If and only if, and for so long as You remain a Qualified Licensee, in accordance with Section 3 of this License Agreement, Author hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, non-sublicensable license Agreement, under patent claims owned or controlled by the Author that are embodied in the Program as furnished by the Author (\"Licensed Claims\") to make, use, sell and offer for sale the Program. Subject to the proviso that You grant all Licensees a world-wide, non-exclusive, royalty-free license under any patent claims embodied in any Derivative Work furnished by You, Author hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, non-sublicensable license under the Licensed Claims to make, use, sell and offer for sale Derivative Works.\r\n\r\n8. Exclusions From License Agreement Grants. Nothing in this License Agreement shall be deemed to grant any rights to trademarks, copyrights, patents, trade secrets or any other intellectual property of Licensor except as expressly stated herein. No patent license is granted to make, use, sell or offer to sell embodiments of any patent claims other than the Licensed Claims defined in Section 7. No right is granted to the trademarks of Author even if such marks are included in the Program. Nothing in this License Agreement shall be interpreted to prohibit Author from licensing under additional or different terms from this License Agreement any Original Work, Program, or Derivative Work that Author otherwise would have a right to License.\r\n\r\n8.1\tImplied Endorsements Prohibited. Neither the name of the Author (in the case of Programs and Original Works released by Hacktivismo, the name \"Hacktivismo\"), nor the names of contributors who helped produce the Program may be used to endorse or promote modifications of the Program, any Derivative Work, or any Software other than the Program, without specific prior written permission of the Author. Neither the name of Hacktivismo nor the names of any contributors who helped write the Program may be used to endorse or promote any Program or Software released under this License Agreement by any person other than Hacktivismo.\r\n\r\n9.\tModifications and Derivative Works. Only Qualified Licensees may modify the Software or prepare or distribute Derivative Works. If You are a Qualified Licensee, Your authorization to modify the Software or prepare or distribute Derivative Works (including permission to prepare and\/or distribute Derivative Works, as provided in Sections 5.2.2, 5.2.3, 6.2, 6.3, and 6.6) is subject to each and all of the following mandatory terms and conditions (9.1 through 9.6, inclusive):\r\n\r\n9.1\tYou must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that You changed the files and the date of any change;\r\n\r\n9.2\tIf the modified Software normally reads commands interactively when run, You must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that You provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under this License Agreement, and telling the user how to view a copy of this License Agreement. (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does not normally print such an announcement, Your Derivative Work based on the Program is not required to print an announcement.);\r\n\r\n9.3\tAny Program, Software, or modification thereof copied or distributed by You, that incorporates any portion of the Original Work, must not contain any code or functionality that subverts the security of the Software or the end-user's expectations of privacy, anonymity, confidentiality, authenticity, and trust, including (without limitation) any code or functionality that introduces any \"backdoor,\" escrow mechanism, \"spy-ware,\" or surveillance techniques or methods into any such Program, Software, or modification thereof;\r\n\r\n9.4\tAny Program, Software, or modification thereof copied or distributed by You, that employs any cryptographic or other security, privacy, confidentiality, authenticity, and\/or trust methods or techniques, including without limitation any Derivative Work that includes any changes or modifications to any cryptographic techniques in the Program, shall employ Strong Cryptography.\r\n\r\n9.5\tAny Program, Software, or modification thereof copied or distributed by You, if it contains any key-generation or selection technique, must not employ any Substandard Key-Selection Technique.\r\n\r\n9.6 No Program or Software copied or distributed by You may transmit or communicate any symmetric key, any \"private key\" if an asymmetric cryptosystem is employed, or any part of such key, nor may it otherwise make any such key or part of such key known, to any person other than the end-user who generated the key, without the active consent and participation of that individual end-user. If a private or symmetric key is stored or recorded in any manner, it must not be stored or recorded in plaintext, and it must be protected from reading (at a minimum) by use of a password. Use of steganography or other techniques to disguise the fact that a private or symmetric key is even stored is strongly encouraged, but not absolutely required.\r\n\r\n10.\tUse Restrictions: Human Rights Violations Prohibited.\r\n\r\n10.1\tNeither the Program, nor any Software or Derivative Work based on the Program may used by You for any of the following purposes (10.1.1 through 10.1.5, inclusive):\r\n\r\n10.1.1\tto violate or infringe any human rights or to deprive any person of human rights, including, without limitation, rights of privacy, security, collective action, expression, political freedom, due process of law, and individual conscience;\r\n\r\n10.1.2\tto gather evidence against any person to be used to deprive any person of human rights;\r\n\r\n10.1.3\tany other use as a part of any project or activity to deprive any person of human rights, including not only the above-listed rights, but also rights of physical security, liberty from physical restraint or incarceration, freedom from slavery, freedom from torture, freedom to take part in government, either directly or through lawfully elected representatives, and\/or freedom from self-incrimination;\r\n\r\n10.1.4\tany surveillance, espionage, or monitoring of individuals, whether done by a Governmental Entity, a Governmental Person, or by any non-governmental person or entity;\r\n\r\n10.1.5\tcensorship or \"filtering\" of any published information or expression.\r\n\r\n10.2\tAdditionally, the Program, any modification of it, or any Software or Derivative Work based on the Program may not be used by any Governmental Entity or other institution that has any policy or practice (whether official or unofficial) of violating the human rights of any persons.\r\n\r\n10.3\tYou may not authorize, permit, or enable any person (including, without limitation, any Governmental Entity or Governmental Person) to use the Program or any Software or Derivative Work based on it (including any use of Your copy or copies of the Program) unless such person has accepted this License Agreement and has become a Licensee subject to all its terms and conditions, including (without limitation) the use restrictions embodied in Section 10.1 and 10.2, inclusive.\r\n\r\n11.\tAll Export Distributions Must Consist of or Be Ancillary to Distribution of Source Code. Because of certain peculiarities of current export-control law, any distribution by You of the Program or any Software may be in the form of Source Code only, or in the form or Source Code accompanied by compiled Object Code, but You may not export any Software in the form of compiled Object Code only. Such an export distribution of compiled executable code must in all cases be ancillary to a distribution of the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be distributed on a medium, or by a method, customarily used for software interchange.\r\n\r\n12.\tEXPORT LAWS: THIS LICENSE AGREEMENT ADDS NO RESTRICTIONS TO THE EXPORT LAWS OF YOUR JURISDICTION. It is Your responsibility to comply with any export regulations applicable in Your jurisdiction. From the United States, Canada, or many countries in Europe, export or transmission of this Software to certain embargoed destinations (including, but not necessarily limited to, Cuba, Iran, Iraq, Libya, North Korea, Sudan, and Syria), may be prohibited. If Hacktivismo is identified as the Author of the Program (and it is not the property of some other Author), then export to any national of Cuba, Iran, Iraq, Libya, North Korea, Sudan or Syria, or into the territory of any of these countries, by any Licensee who has received this Software directly from Hacktivismo or from the Cult of the Dead Cow, or any of their members, is contractually prohibited and will constitute a violation of this License Agreement. You are advised to consult the current laws of any and all countries whose laws may apply to You, before exporting this Software to any destination. Special care should be taken to avoid export to any embargoed destination. An Author other than Hacktivismo may substitute that Author's legal name for \"Hacktivismo\" in this Paragraph, in relation to any Program released by that Author under this Paragraph.\r\n\r\n13.\tContrary Judgments, Settlements and Court Orders. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on You (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License Agreement, they do not excuse You from the conditions of this License Agreement. If You cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously Your obligations under this License Agreement and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence You may not distribute the Software at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through You, then the only way You could satisfy both it and this License Agreement would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.\r\n\r\nIt is not the purpose of this Section 13 to induce You to infringe any patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this Section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the software distribution system reflected in this License Agreement, which is implemented by public license practices. Many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed through related distribution systems, in reliance on consistent application of such distribution systems; it is up to the Author\/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute software through any other system and a Licensee cannot impose that choice.\r\n\r\n14. Governmental Entities: Any Governmental Entity (\"Governmental Entity\" is defined broadly as set forth in Section 0.13.1) or Governmental Person (as \"Governmental Person\" is defined broadly in Section 0.13.2), that uses, modifies, changes, copies, displays, performs, or distributes the Program, or any Software or Derivative Work based on the Program, may do so if and only if all of the following terms and conditions (14.1 through 14.10, inclusive) are agreed to and fully met:\r\n\r\n14.1 If it is the position of any Governmental Entity (or, in the case of any \"Governmental Person,\" if it is the position of that Governmental Person's Governmental Entity) that any doctrine or doctrines of law (including, without limitation, any doctrine(s) of immunity or any formalities of contract formation) may render this License Agreement unenforceable or less than fully enforceable against such Governmental Entity, or any Governmental Person of such Governmental Entity, then prior to any use, modification, change, display, performance, copy or distribution of the Program, or of any Software or Derivative Work based on the Program, or any part thereof, by the Governmental Entity, or by any Governmental Person of that Governmental Entity, the Governmental Entity shall be required to inform the Author in writing of each such doctrine that is believed to render this License Agreement or any part of it less than fully enforceable against such Governmental Entity or any Governmental Person of such entity, and to explain in reasonable detail what additional steps, if taken, would render the License Agreement fully enforceable against such entity or person. Failure to provide the required written notice to the Author in advance of any such use, modification, change, display, performance, copy or distribution, shall constitute an irrevocable and conclusive waiver of any and all reliance on any doctrine, by the Governmental Entity, that is not included or that is omitted from the required written notice (failure to provide any written notice means all reliance on any doctrine is irrevocably waived). Any Governmental Entity that provides written notice under this subsection is prohibited, as are all of the Governmental Persons of such Governmental Entity, from making any use, change, display, performance, copy, modification or distribution of the Software or any part thereof, until such time as a License Agreement is in place, agreed upon by the Author and by the Governmental Entity, that such entity concedes is fully-enforceable. Any use, modification, change, display, performance, copy, or distribution following written notice under this Paragraph, but without the implementation of an agreement as provided herein, shall constitute an irrevocable and conclusive waiver by the Governmental Entity (and any and all Governmental Persons of such Governmental Entity) of any and all reliance on any legal doctrine either referenced in such written notice or omitted from it.\r\n\r\n14.2\tAny Governmental Entity that uses, copies, changes, modifies, or distributes, the Software or any part or portion thereof, or any Governmental Person who does so (whether that person's Governmental Entity contends the person's action was, or was not, authorized or official), permanently and irrevocably waives any defense based on sovereign immunity, official immunity, the Act of State Doctrine, or any other form of immunity, that might otherwise apply as a defense to, or a bar against, any legal action based on the terms of this License Agreement.\r\n\r\n14.2.1\tWith respect to any enforcement action brought by the Author in a United States court against a foreign Governmental Entity, the waiver by any Governmental Entity as provided in Subparagraphs 14.1 and 14.2 is hereby expressly acknowledged by each such Governmental Entity to constitute a \"case . . . in which the foreign state has waived its immunity,\" within the scope of 28 U.S.C. \u0015 1605(a)(1) of the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act of 1976 (as amended). Each such Governmental Entity also specifically agrees and concedes that the \"commercial activity\" exceptions to the FSIA, 28 U.S.C. \u0015 1605(a)(2), (3) are also applicable. With respect to an action brought against the United States or any United States Governmental Entity, in the courts of any country, the U.S. Governmental Entity shall be understood to have voluntarily agreed to a corresponding waiver of immunity from actions in the courts of any other sovereign.\r\n\r\n14.2.2\tWith respect to any enforcement action brought by an authorized end-user (as a third-party beneficiary, under the terms of Subparagraphs 14.3 and 14.10) in a United States court against a foreign Governmental Entity, the waiver by any Governmental Entity as provided in Subparagraphs 14.1 and 14.2 is hereby expressly acknowledged by each such Governmental Entity to constitute a \"case . . . in which the foreign state has waived its immunity,\" within the scope of 28 U.S.C. \u0015 1605(a)(1) of the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act of 1976 (as amended). . Each such Governmental Entity also specifically agrees and concedes that the \"commercial activity\" exceptions to the FSIA, 28 U.S.C. \u0015 1605(a)(2), (3) are also applicable. With respect to an action brought against the United States or any United States Governmental Entity, in the courts of any country, the U.S. Governmental Entity shall be understood to have voluntarily agreed to a corresponding waiver of immunity from actions in the courts of any other sovereign.\r\n\r\n14.2.3\tWith respect to any action or effort by the Author in the United States to execute a judgment against a foreign Governmental Entity, by attaching or executing process against the property of such Governmental Entity, the waiver by any Governmental Entity as provided in Subparagraphs 14.1 and 14.2 is hereby expressly acknowledged by each such Governmental Entity to constitute a case in which \"the foreign state has waived its immunity from attachment in aid of execution or from execution,\" in accordance with 28 U.S.C. \u0015 1610(a)(1) of the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act of 1976 (as amended). Each such Governmental Entity also specifically agrees and concedes that the \"commercial activity\" exceptions to the FSIA, 28 U.S.C. \u0015 1610(a)(2), (d) are also applicable. With respect to an action brought against the United States or any United States Governmental Entity, in the courts of any country, the U.S. Governmental Entity shall be understood to have voluntarily agreed to a corresponding waiver of immunity from actions in the courts of any other sovereign.\r\n\r\n14.2.4\tWith respect to any action or effort brought by an authorized end-user (as a third-party beneficiary, in accordance with Subparagraphs 14.3 and 14.10) in the United States to execute a judgment against a foreign Governmental Entity, by attaching or executing process against the property of such Governmental Entity, the waiver by any Governmental Entity as provided in Subparagraphs 14.1 and 14.2 is hereby expressly acknowledged by each such Governmental Entity to constitute a case in which \"the foreign state has waived its immunity from attachment in aid of execution or from execution,\" in accordance with 28 U.S.C. \u0015 1610(a)(1) of the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act of 1976 (as amended). Each such Governmental Entity also specifically agrees and concedes that the \"commercial activity\" exceptions to the FSIA, 28 U.S.C. \u0015 1610(a)(2), (d) are also applicable. With respect to an action brought against the United States or any United States Governmental Entity, in the courts of any country, the U.S. Governmental Entity shall be understood to have voluntarily agreed to a corresponding waiver of immunity from actions in the courts of any other sovereign.\r\n\r\n14.3\tAny Governmental Entity that uses, copies, changes, modifies, displays, performs, or distributes the Software or any part thereof, or any Governmental Person who does so (whether that person's Governmental Entity contends the person's action was, or was not, authorized or official), and thereby violates any terms and conditions of Section 9 (restrictions on modification), or Paragraph 10 (use restrictions), agrees that the person or entity is subject not only to an action by the Author, for the enforcement of this License Agreement and for money damages and injunctive relief (as well as attorneys' fees, additional and statutory damages, and other remedies as provided by law), but such Governmental Entity and\/or Person also shall be subject to a suit for money damages and injunctive relief by any person whose human rights have been violated or infringed, in violation of this License Agreement, or through the use of any Software in violation of this License Agreement. Any person who brings an action under this section against any Governmental Person or Entity must notify the Author promptly of the action and provide the Author the opportunity to intervene to assert the Author's own rights. Damages in such a third-party action shall be measured by the severity of the human rights violation and the copyright infringement or License Agreement violation, combined, and not merely by reference to the copyright infringement. All end-users, to the extent that they are entitled to bring suit against such Governmental Entity by way of this License Agreement, are intended third-party beneficiaries of this License Agreement. Punitive damages may be awarded in such a third-party action against a Governmental Entity or Governmental Person, and each and every such Governmental Entity or Person conclusively waives all restrictions on the amount of punitive damages, and all defenses to the award of punitive damages to the extend such limitations or defenses depend upon or are a function of such person or entity's status as a Governmental Person or Governmental Entity.\r\n\r\n14.4\tAny State of the United States, or any subunit or Governmental Entity thereof, that uses, copies, changes, modifies, displays, performs, or distributes the Software of any part thereof, or any of whose Governmental Persons does so (whether that person's Governmental Entity contends the person's action was, or was not, authorized or official), unconditionally and irrevocably waives for purposes of any legal action (i) to enforce this License Agreement, (ii) to remedy infringement of the Author's copyright, or (iii) to invoke any of the third-party beneficiary rights set forth in Section 14.3 -- any immunity under the Eleventh Amendment of the United States Constitution or any other immunity doctrine (such as sovereign immunity or qualified, or other, official immunity) that may apply to state governments, subunits, or to their Governmental Persons.\r\n\r\n14.5\tAny Governmental Entity (including, without limitation, any State of the United States), that uses, copies, changes, modifies, performs, displays, or distributes the Software or any part thereof, or any of whose Governmental Persons does so (whether that person's Governmental Entity contends the person's action was, or was not, authorized or official), unconditionally and irrevocably waives for purposes of any legal action (i) to enforce this License Agreement, (ii) to remedy infringement of the Author's copyright, or (iii) to invoke any of the third-party beneficiary rights set forth in Section 14.3 any doctrine (such as, but not limited to, the holding in the United States Supreme Court decision of Ex Parte Young) that might purport to limit remedies solely to prospective injunctive relief. Also explicitly and irrevocably waived is any underlying immunity doctrine that would require the recognition of such a limited exception for purposes of remedies. The remedies against such governmental entities and persons shall explicitly include money damages, additional damages, statutory damages, consequential damages, exemplary damages, punitive damages, costs and fees that might otherwise be barred or limited in amount on account of governmental status.\r\n\r\n14.6\tAny Governmental Entity that uses, copies, changes, modifies, displays, performs, or distributes the Software or any part thereof, or any of whose Governmental Persons does so (whether that person's Governmental Entity contends the person's action was, or was not, authorized or official), unconditionally and irrevocably waives for purposes of any legal action (i) to enforce this License Agreement, (ii) to remedy infringement of the Author's copyright, or (iii) to invoke any of the third-party beneficiary rights set forth in Section 14.3 any and all reliance on the Act of State doctrine, sovereign immunity, international comity, or any other doctrine of immunity whether such doctrine is recognized in that government's own courts, or in the courts of any other government or nation.\r\n\r\n14.6.1\tConsistent with Subparagraphs 14.2.1 through 14.2.4, this waiver shall explicitly be understood to constitute a waiver not only against suit, but also against execution against property, for purposes of the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act of 1976 (as amended). All United States Governmental Entities shall be understood to have agreed to a corresponding waiver of immunity against (i) suit in the courts of other sovereigns, and (ii) execution against property of the United States located within the territory of other countries.\r\n\r\n14.7\tGovernmental Persons, (i) who violate this License Agreement (whether that person's Governmental Entity contends the person's action was, or was not, authorized or official), or (ii) who are personally involved in any activity, policy or practice of a governmental entity that violates this License Agreement (whether that person's Governmental Entity contends the person's action was, or was not, authorized or official), or (iii) that use, copy, change, modify, perform, display or distribute, the Software or any part thereof, when their Governmental Entity is not permitted to do so, or is not a Qualified Licensee, or has violated the terms of this License Agreement, each and all individually waive and shall not be permitted to assert any defense of official immunity, \"good faith\" immunity, qualified immunity, absolute immunity, or other immunity based on his or her governmental status.\r\n\r\n14.8\tNo Governmental Entity, nor any Governmental Person thereof may, by legislative, regulatory, or other action, exempt such Governmental Entity, subunit, or person, from the terms of this License Agreement, if the Governmental Entity or any such person has voluntarily used, modified, copied, displayed, performed, or distributed the Software or any part thereof.\r\n\r\n14.9\tEnforcement In Courts of Other Sovereigns Permitted. By using, modifying, changing, displaying, performing or distributing any Software covered by this License Agreement, any Governmental Entity hereby voluntarily and irrevocably consents, for purposes of (i) any action to enforce the terms of this License Agreement, and (ii) any action to enforce the Author's copyright (whether such suit be for injunctive relief, damages, or both) to the jurisdiction of any court or tribunal in any other country (or a court of competent jurisdiction of a subunit, province, or state of such country) in which the terms of this License Agreement are believed by the Author to be enforceable. Each such Governmental Entity hereby waives all objections to personal jurisdiction, all objections based on international comity, all objections based on the doctrine of forum non conveniens, and all objections based on sovereign or governmental status or immunity that might otherwise be asserted in the courts of some other sovereign.\r\n\r\n14.9.1\tThe Waiver by any Governmental Entity of a country other than the United States shall be understood explicitly to constitute a waiver for purposes of the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act of 1976 (see Subparagraphs 14.2.1to 14.2.4, inclusive, supra), and all United States Governmental Entities shall be understood to have agreed to a waive correspondingly broad in scope with respect to actions brought in the courts of other sovereigns.\r\n\r\n14.9.2\tForum Selection Non-U.S. Governmental Entities. Governmental Entities that are not United States Governmental Entities shall be subject to suit, and agree to be subject to suit, in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia. The Author or an authorized end-user may bring an action in another court in another country, but the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, shall always be available as an agreed-upon forum for such an action. At the optional election of any Author (or, in the case of a third-party claim, any end-user asserting rights under Subparagraphs 14.3 and 14.10), such a suit against a non-U.S. Governmental Entity or Person may be brought in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, or the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, as a direct substitute for the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, for all purposes of this Subparagraph.\r\n\r\n14.9.3\tForum Selection U.S. Governmental Entities. All United States Governmental Entities shall be subject to suit, and agree to be subject to suit, in the following (non-exclusive) list of fora: Ottawa, Canada, London, England, and Paris, France. The Author or an authorized end-user may bring action in another court that can exercise jurisdiction. But the courts in these three locations shall always be available (at the option of the Author or an authorized end-user) as a forum for resolving any dispute with the United States or a governmental subunit thereof. Except as provided in Subparagraph 14.10, any and all United States Governmental Persons shall be subject to suit wherever applicable rules of personal jurisdiction and venue shall permit such suit to be filed, but no such United States Governmental Person may assert any defense based on forum non conveniens or international comity, to the selection of any particular lawful venue.\r\n\r\n14.10\tEnforcement Of Claims For Human Rights Violations. By using, copying, modifying, changing, performing, displaying or distributing the Software covered by this License Agreement, any Governmental Entity, or Governmental Person hereby voluntarily and irrevocably consents -- for purposes of any third-party action to remedy human rights violations and other violations of this License Agreement (as reflected in Section 14.3) -- to the jurisdiction of any court or tribunal in any other country (or a court of competent jurisdiction of a subunit, province, or state of such country) in which the third-party beneficiary reasonably believes the relevant terms of this License Agreement are enforceable. The Governmental Entity or Person hereby waives all objections to personal jurisdiction, all objections based on international comity, all objections based on the doctrine of forum non conveniens, and all objections based on sovereign or governmental status or immunity that might otherwise be asserted in the courts of some other sovereign.\r\n\r\n14.10.1\tWaiver of Immunity and Forum Selection. The presumptively valid and preferred fora identified in Subparagraphs 14.9.2 and 14.9.3 shall also apply for purposes of Subparagraph 14.10. All Governmental Entities are subject to the same Waiver of Immunity as set forth in Subparagraphs 14.2.1 to 14.2.4, inclusive.\r\n\r\n15. Subsequent Versions of HESSLA. Hacktivismo may publish revised and\/or new versions of the Hacktivismo Enhanced-Source Software License Agreement from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\r\n\r\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number. Any Program released by Hacktivismo under a version of this License Agreement prior to Version 1.0, shall be considered released under Version 1.0 of the Hacktivismo Enhanced-Source Software License Agreement, once Version 1.0 is formally released. Prior to Version 1.0, any Software released by Hacktivismo or a Licensee of Hacktivismo under a lower-numbered version of the HESSLA shall be considered automatically to be subject to a higher-number version of the HESSLA, whenever a later-numbered version has been released.\r\n\r\nConcerning the work of any other Author, if the Program specifies a version number of this License Agreement which applies to it and \"any later version,\" You have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later version published by Hacktivismo. If the Program does not specify a version number of this License Agreement, You may choose any version after 1.0, once version 1.0 is published by Hacktivismo, and prior to publication of version 1.0, You may choose any version of the Hacktivismo Software License Agreement then published by Hacktivismo. If the Program released by another Author, specifies only a version number, then that version number only shall apply. If \"the latest version,\" is specified, then the latest version of the HESSLA published on the Hacktivismo Website shall always apply at all times.\r\n\r\n16. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY. THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN \"AS IS\" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE WARRANTY OF NON-INFRINGEMENT AND WARRANTIES THAT THE ORIGINAL WORK IS MERCHANTABLE OR FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED WITH ALL FAULTS. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY OF THE ORIGINAL WORK IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO LICENSE TO ORIGINAL WORK IS GRANTED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.\r\n\r\n17.\t LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING THE AUTHOR'S NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL THE AUTHOR BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER ARISING AS A RESULT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE SOFTWARE INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PERSON SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION, BUT SHALL EXCLUDE SUCH LIABILITY TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\r\n\r\n18.\tENCRYPTION KEYS AND PUBLIC KEY INFRASTRUCTURE. SOFTWARE RELEASED UNDER THIS LICENSE AGREEMENT MAY REQUIRE A DIGITAL CERTIFICATE, OR AN ENCRYPTION KEY \"SIGNED\" BY A TRUSTED PARTY, TO FUNCTION. AUTHOR UNDERTAKES NO RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE PROPER, SECURE, AND ADEQUATE FUNCTIONING OF ANY CRYPTOGRAPHIC SYSTEMS, OF ANY CRYPTOGRAPHIC KEYS, OR FOR THE TRUSTWORTHINESS OF ANY END-USER, ANY ISSUER OF CERTIFICATES, OR OF ANY SIGNER OF ENCRYPTION KEYS. USE OF THIS SOFTWARE IS AT THE END-USER'S SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE RISK. IN ANY PUBLIC-KEY INFRASTRUCTURE (\"PKI\") SYSTEM, AN END-USER'S LEGAL RELATIONSHIP WITH THE END-USER'S CERTIFICATION AUTHORITY DOES NOT INCLUDE OR ENCOMPASS ANY LEGAL RELATIONSHIP WITH THE AUTHOR, AND IS GOVERNED SOLELY AND EXCLUSIVELY BY THE CERTIFICATION AUTHORITY'S CERTIFICATION PRACTICE STATEMENT AND CERTIFICATION AGREEMENTS. AUTHOR ASSUMES NO RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE ACTIONS OR OMISSIONS OF ANY END-USER OR ANY CERTIFICATION AUTHORITY.\r\n\r\n18.\tSaving Clause. If any portion of this License Agreement is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance, the balance of the License Agreement is intended to apply and the License Agreement as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.\r\n\r\nEND OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS",

If Contributor has actual knowledge that a license under a third party's intellectual property rights is required to exercise the rights granted by such Contributor under Sections 2.1 or 2.2, Contributor must include a text file with the Source Code distribution titled \"LEGAL\" which describes the claim and the party making the claim in sufficient detail that a recipient will know whom to contact. If Contributor obtains such knowledge after the Modification is made available as described in Section 3.2, Contributor shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies Contributor makes available thereafter.\r\n(b) Contributor API's. If Contributor's Modifications include an application programming interface and Contributor has actual knowledge of patent licenses which are reasonably necessary to implement that API, Contributor must also include this information in the LEGAL file.\r\n(c) Representations. Contributor represents that, except as disclosed pursuant to Section 3.4(a) above, Contributor believes that Contributor's Modifications are Contributor's original creation(s) and\/or Contributor has sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by this License.\r\n3.5 Required Notices. You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source Code. If it is not possible to put such notice in a particular Source Code file due to its structure, then You must include such notice in a location (such as a relevant directory) where a user would be most likely to look for such a notice. If You created one or more Modification(s) You may add your name as a Contributor to the notice described in Exhibit A. You must also duplicate this License in any documentation for the Source Code where You describe recipients' rights or ownership rights relating to Covered Code. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Code. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability (excluding any liability arising from intellectual property claims relating to the Covered Code) incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.\r\n3.6 Distribution of Executable Versions. You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the requirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered Code, and if You include a notice stating that the Source Code version of the Covered Code is available under the terms of this License, including a description of how and where You have fulfilled the obligation of Section 3.2. The notice must be conspicuously included in any notice in an Executable version, related documentation or collateral in which You describe recipients' rights relating to the Covered Code. You may distribute the Executable version of Covered Code or ownership rights under a license of Your choice, which may contain terms different from this License, provided that You are in compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the Executable version does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient's rights in the Source Code version from the rights set forth in this License. If You distribute the Executable version under a different license You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ from this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability (excluding any liability arising from intellectual property claims relating to the Covered Code) incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such terms You offer.\r\n3.7 Larger Works. You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other code not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code.\r\n4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation. If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License with respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must be included in the LEGAL file described in Section 3.4 and must be included with all distributions of the Source Code. Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.\r\n\r\n5. Application of this License. This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has attached the notice in Exhibit A and to related Covered Code.\r\n\r\n6. Versions of the License.\r\n\r\n6.1 New Versions. The Storage Networking Industry Association (the \"SNIA\") may publish revised and\/or new versions of the License from time to time. Each version will be given a distinguishing version number.\r\n6.2 Effect of New Versions. Once Covered Code has been published under a particular version of the License, You may always continue to use it under the terms of that version. You may also choose to use such Covered Code under the terms of any subsequent version of the License published by the SNIA. No one other than the SNIA has the right to modify the terms applicable to Covered Code created under this License.\r\n6.3 Derivative Works. If You create or use a modified version of this License (which you may only do in order to apply it to code which is not already Covered Code governed by this License), You must (a) rename Your license so that the phrases \"Storage Networking Industry Association,\" \"SNIA,\" or any confusingly similar phrase do not appear in your license (except to note that your license differs from this License) and (b) otherwise make it clear that Your version of the license contains terms which differ from the SNIA Public License. (Filling in the name of the Initial Developer, Original Code or Contributor in the notice described in Exhibit A shall not of themselves be deemed to be modifications of this License.)\r\n7. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY. COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN \"AS IS\" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED CODE IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED CODE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED CODE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED CODE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.\r\n\r\n8. TERMINATION.\r\n\r\n8.1 This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure such breach within a reasonable time after becoming aware of the breach. All sublicenses to the Covered Code which are properly granted shall survive any termination of this License. Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License shall survive.\r\n8.2 If You initiate litigation by asserting a patent infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions) against Initial Developer or a Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom You file such action is referred to as \"Participant\") alleging that:\r\n(a) such Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted by such Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and\/or 2.2 of this License shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate prospectively, unless if within 60 days after receipt of notice You either: (i) agree in writing to pay Participant a mutually agreeable reasonable royalty for Your past and future use of Modifications made by such Participant, or (ii) withdraw Your litigation claim with respect to the Contributor Version against such Participant. If within 60 days of notice, a reasonable royalty and payment arrangement are not mutually agreed upon in writing by the parties or the litigation claim is not withdrawn, the rights granted by Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and\/or 2.2 automatically terminate at the expiration of the 60 day notice period specified above.\r\n8.3 If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant alleging that such Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as by license or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses granted by such Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken into account in determining the amount or value of any payment or license.\r\n \r\n\r\n8.4 In the event of termination under Sections 8.1 or 8.2 above, all end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder prior to termination shall survive termination.\r\n9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED CODE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\r\n\r\n10. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS. The Covered Code is a \"commercial item,\" as that term is defined in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of \"commercial computer software\" and \"commercial computer software documentation,\" as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Code with only those rights set forth herein.\r\n\r\n11. MISCELLANEOUS This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be governed by California law provisions (except to the extent applicable law, if any, provides otherwise), excluding its conflict-of-law provisions. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not apply to this License.\r\n\r\n12. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS. As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly, out of its utilization of rights under this License and You agree to work with Initial Developer and Contributors to distribute such responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing herein is intended or shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability.\r\n\r\n13. MULTIPLE-LICENSED CODE. Initial Developer may designate portions of the Covered Code as \"Multiple-Licensed\". \"Multiple-Licensed\" means that the Initial Developer permits you to utilize portions of the Covered Code under Your choice of this License or the alternative licenses, if any, specified by the Initial Developer in the file described in Exhibit A.\r\n\r\n14. ACCEPTANCE. This License is accepted by You if You retain, use, or distribute the Covered Code for any purpose.\r\n\r\nEXHIBIT A \u2014The SNIA Public License.\r\n\r\nThe contents of this file are subject to the SNIA Public License Version 1.1 (the \"License\"); you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.

ALL SUBLICENSES TO THE COVERED CODE WHICH ARE PROPERLY GRANTED SHALL SURVIVE ANY TERMINATION OF THIS LICENSE. PROVISIONS WHICH, BY THEIR NATURE, MUST REMAIN IN EFFECT BEYOND THE TERMINATION OF THIS LICENSE SHALL SURVIVE.\r\n\r\n8.2.

You may not sublicense the Work. You must keep intact all\r\nnotices that refer to this License and to the disclaimer of warranties.\r\nYou may not distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly\r\ndigitally perform the Work with any technological measures that control\r\naccess or use of the Work in a manner inconsistent with the terms of\r\nthis License Agreement. The above applies to the Work as incorporated in\r\na Collective Work, but this does not require the Collective Work apart\r\nfrom the Work itself to be made subject to the terms of this License. If\r\nYou create a Collective Work, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to\r\nthe extent practicable, remove from the Collective Work any credit as\r\nrequired by clause 4(b), as requested.\r\n\r\nb. If you distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly\r\ndigitally perform the Work or Collective Works, You must keep intact all\r\ncopyright notices for the Work and provide, reasonable to the medium or\r\nmeans You are utilizing: (i) the name of the Original Author (or\r\npseudonym, if applicable) if supplied, and\/or (ii) if the Original\r\nAuthor and\/or Licensor designate another party or parties (e.g. a\r\nsponsor institute, publishing entity, journal) for attribution in\r\nLicensor's copyright notice, terms of service or by other reasonable\r\nmeans, the name of such party or parties; the title of the Work if\r\nsupplied; and to the extent reasonably practicable, the Uniform Resource\r\nIdentifier, if any, that Licensor specifies to be associated with the\r\nWork, unless such URI does not refer to the copyright notice or\r\nlicensing information for the Work. Such credit may be implemented in\r\nany reasonable manner; provided, however, that in the case of a\r\nCollective Work, at a minimum such credit will appear where any other\r\ncomparable authorship credit appears and in a manner at least as\r\nprominent as such other comparable authorship credit.\r\n\r\n5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer\r\n\r\nUNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR\r\nOFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY\r\nKIND CONCERNING THE MATERIALS, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE,\r\nINCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY,\r\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF\r\nLATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS,\r\nWHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE\r\nEXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\r\n\r\n6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE\r\nLAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR\r\nANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES\r\nARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS\r\nBEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\r\n\r\n7. Termination\r\n\r\na. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate\r\nautomatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this License.\r\nIndividuals or entities who have received Collective Works from You\r\nunder this License, however, will not have their licenses terminated\r\nprovided such individuals or entities remain in full compliance with\r\nthose licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any\r\ntermination of this License.\r\n\r\nb. Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here\r\nis perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work).\r\nNotwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the\r\nWork under different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at\r\nany time; provided, however that any such election will not serve to\r\nwithdraw this License (or any other license that has been, or is\r\nrequired to be, granted under the terms of this License), and this\r\nLicense will continue in full force and effect unless terminated as\r\nstated above.\r\n\r\n8. Miscellaneous\r\n\r\na. Each time You distribute or publicly digitally perform the Work, the\r\nLicensor offers to the recipient a license to the Work on the same terms\r\nand conditions as the license granted to You under this License.\r\n\r\nb. If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under\r\napplicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of\r\nthe remainder of the terms of this License, and without further action\r\nby the parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to\r\nthe minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and\r\nenforceable.\r\n\r\nc. No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no\r\nbreach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing\r\nand signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or consent.\r\n\r\nd. This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties\r\nwith respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings,\r\nagreements or representations with respect to the Work not specified\r\nhere. Licensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions that may\r\nappear in any communication from You.

Waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in which\r\nthe right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory\r\nlicensing scheme can be waived, the Licensor waives the exclusive right\r\nto collect such royalties for any exercise by You of the rights granted\r\nunder this License; and,\r\n\r\niii.

The above rights include the right to make\r\nsuch modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights\r\nin other media and formats, but otherwise you have no rights to make\r\nAdaptations. Subject to Section 8(f), all rights not expressly granted\r\nby Licensor are hereby reserved.\r\n\r\n4. Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly\r\nmade subject to and limited by the following restrictions:\r\n\r\na. You may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work only under the terms\r\nof this License. You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource\r\nIdentifier (URI) for, this License with every copy of the Work You\r\nDistribute or Publicly Perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on\r\nthe Work that restrict the terms of this License or the ability of the\r\nrecipient of the Work to exercise the rights granted to that recipient\r\nunder the terms of the License. You may not sublicense the Work. You\r\nmust keep intact all notices that refer to this License and to the\r\ndisclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work You Distribute or\r\nPublicly Perform.

This\r\nSection 4(a) applies to the Work as incorporated in a Collection, but\r\nthis does not require the Collection apart from the Work itself to be\r\nmade subject to the terms of this License. If You create a Collection,\r\nupon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable,\r\nremove from the Collection any credit as required by Section 4(b), as\r\nrequested.\r\n\r\nb.

The credit required by this Section 4(b) may\r\nbe implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however, that in the\r\ncase of a Collection, at a minimum such credit will appear, if a credit\r\nfor all contributing authors of the Collection appears, then as part of\r\nthese credits and in a manner at least as prominent as the credits for\r\nthe other contributing authors. For the avoidance of doubt, You may only\r\nuse the credit required by this Section for the purpose of attribution\r\nin the manner set out above and, by exercising Your rights under this\r\nLicense, You may not implicitly or explicitly assert or imply any\r\nconnection with, sponsorship or endorsement by the Original Author,\r\nLicensor and\/or Attribution Parties, as appropriate, of You or Your use\r\nof the Work, without the separate, express prior written permission of\r\nthe Original Author, Licensor and\/or Attribution Parties.\r\n\r\nc.

SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE\r\nEXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\r\n\r\n6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE\r\nLAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR\r\nANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES\r\nARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS\r\nBEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\r\n\r\n7. Termination\r\n\r\na. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate\r\nautomatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this License.\r\nIndividuals or entities who have received Collections from You under\r\nthis License, however, will not have their licenses terminated provided\r\nsuch individuals or entities remain in full compliance with those\r\nlicenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any termination of\r\nthis License.\r\n\r\nb. Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here\r\nis perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work).\r\nNotwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the\r\nWork under different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at\r\nany time; provided, however that any such election will not serve to\r\nwithdraw this License (or any other license that has been, or is\r\nrequired to be, granted under the terms of this License), and this\r\nLicense will continue in full force and effect unless terminated as\r\nstated above.\r\n\r\n8. Miscellaneous\r\n\r\na. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work or a\r\nCollection, the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Work\r\non the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under\r\nthis License.\r\n\r\nb. If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under\r\napplicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of\r\nthe remainder of the terms of this License, and without further action\r\nby the parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to\r\nthe minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and\r\nenforceable.\r\n\r\nc. No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no\r\nbreach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing\r\nand signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or consent.\r\n\r\nd. This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties\r\nwith respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings,\r\nagreements or representations with respect to the Work not specified\r\nhere. Licensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions that may\r\nappear in any communication from You. This License may not be modified\r\nwithout the mutual written agreement of the Licensor and You.\r\n\r\ne. The rights granted under, and the subject matter referenced, in this\r\nLicense were drafted utilizing the terminology of the Berne Convention\r\nfor the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (as amended on\r\nSeptember 28, 1979), the Rome Convention of 1961, the WIPO Copyright\r\nTreaty of 1996, the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty of 1996 and\r\nthe Universal Copyright Convention (as revised on July 24, 1971). These\r\nrights and subject matter take effect in the relevant jurisdiction in\r\nwhich the License terms are sought to be enforced according to the\r\ncorresponding provisions of the implementation of those treaty\r\nprovisions in the applicable national law. If the standard suite of\r\nrights granted under applicable copyright law includes additional rights\r\nnot granted under this License, such additional rights are deemed to be\r\nincluded in the License; this License is not intended to restrict the\r\nlicense of any rights under applicable law.\r\n\r\n\r\nCreative Commons Notice\r\n\r\nCreative Commons is not a party to this License, and makes no warranty\r\nwhatsoever in connection with the Work.

If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or any Adaptations or\r\nCollections, You must, unless a request has been made pursuant to\r\nSection 4(a), keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and\r\nprovide, reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing: (i) the\r\nname of the Original Author (or pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied,\r\nand\/or if the Original Author and\/or Licensor designate another party or\r\nparties (e.g., a sponsor institute, publishing entity, journal) for\r\nattribution (\"Attribution Parties\") in Licensor's copyright notice,\r\nterms of service or by other reasonable means, the name of such party or\r\nparties; (ii) the title of the Work if supplied; (iii) to the extent\r\nreasonably practicable, the URI, if any, that Licensor specifies to be\r\nassociated with the Work, unless such URI does not refer to the\r\ncopyright notice or licensing information for the Work; and, (iv)\r\nconsistent with Section 3(b), in the case of an Adaptation, a credit\r\nidentifying the use of the Work in the Adaptation (e.g., \"French\r\ntranslation of the Work by Original Author,\" or \"Screenplay based on\r\noriginal Work by Original Author\"). The credit required by this Section\r\n4(d) may be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however,\r\nthat in the case of a Adaptation or Collection, at a minimum such credit\r\nwill appear, if a credit for all contributing authors of the Adaptation\r\nor Collection appears, then as part of these credits and in a manner at\r\nleast as prominent as the credits for the other contributing authors.\r\nFor the avoidance of doubt, You may only use the credit required by this\r\nSection for the purpose of attribution in the manner set out above and,\r\nby exercising Your rights under this License, You may not implicitly or\r\nexplicitly assert or imply any connection with, sponsorship or\r\nendorsement by the Original Author, Licensor and\/or Attribution Parties,\r\nas appropriate, of You or Your use of the Work, without the separate,\r\nexpress prior written permission of the Original Author, Licensor and\/or\r\nAttribution Parties.\r\n\r\ne.

Waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in which\r\nthe right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory\r\nlicensing scheme can be waived, the Licensor reserves the exclusive\r\nright to collect such royalties for any exercise by You of the rights\r\ngranted under this License if Your exercise of such rights is for a\r\npurpose or use which is otherwise than noncommercial as permitted under\r\nSection 4(c) and otherwise waives the right to collect royalties through\r\nany statutory or compulsory licensing scheme; and,\r\n\r\niii. Voluntary License Schemes. The Licensor reserves the right to\r\ncollect royalties, whether individually or, in the event that the\r\nLicensor is a member of a collecting society that administers voluntary\r\nlicensing schemes, via that society, from any exercise by You of the\r\nrights granted under this License that is for a purpose or use which is\r\notherwise than noncommercial as permitted under Section 4(c).\r\n\r\nf. Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor or as may be\r\notherwise permitted by applicable law, if You Reproduce, Distribute or\r\nPublicly Perform the Work either by itself or as part of any Adaptations\r\nor Collections, You must not distort, mutilate, modify or take other\r\nderogatory action in relation to the Work which would be prejudicial to\r\nthe Original Author's honor or reputation. Licensor agrees that in those\r\njurisdictions (e.g. Japan), in which any exercise of the right granted\r\nin Section 3(b) of this License (the right to make Adaptations) would be\r\ndeemed to be a distortion, mutilation, modification or other derogatory\r\naction prejudicial to the Original Author's honor and reputation, the\r\nLicensor will waive or not assert, as appropriate, this Section, to the\r\nfullest extent permitted by the applicable national law, to enable You\r\nto reasonably exercise Your right under Section 3(b) of this License\r\n(right to make Adaptations) but not otherwise.\r\n\r\n5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer\r\n\r\nUNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING AND TO THE\r\nFULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, LICENSOR OFFERS THE WORK\r\nAS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING\r\nTHE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT\r\nLIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A\r\nPARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER\r\nDEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT\r\nDISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED\r\nWARRANTIES, SO THIS EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\r\n\r\n6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE\r\nLAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR\r\nANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES\r\nARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS\r\nBEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\r\n\r\n7. Termination\r\n\r\na. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate\r\nautomatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this License.\r\nIndividuals or entities who have received Adaptations or Collections\r\nfrom You under this License, however, will not have their licenses\r\nterminated provided such individuals or entities remain in full\r\ncompliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will\r\nsurvive any termination of this License.\r\n\r\nb. Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here\r\nis perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work).\r\nNotwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the\r\nWork under different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at\r\nany time; provided, however that any such election will not serve to\r\nwithdraw this License (or any other license that has been, or is\r\nrequired to be, granted under the terms of this License), and this\r\nLicense will continue in full force and effect unless terminated as\r\nstated above.\r\n\r\n8. Miscellaneous\r\n\r\na. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work or a\r\nCollection, the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Work\r\non the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under\r\nthis License.\r\n\r\nb. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation, Licensor\r\noffers to the recipient a license to the original Work on the same terms\r\nand conditions as the license granted to You under this License.\r\n\r\nc. If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under\r\napplicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of\r\nthe remainder of the terms of this License, and without further action\r\nby the parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to\r\nthe minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and\r\nenforceable.\r\n\r\nd. No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no\r\nbreach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing\r\nand signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or consent.\r\n\r\ne. This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties\r\nwith respect to the Work licensed here.

These\r\nrights and subject matter take effect in the relevant jurisdiction in\r\nwhich the License terms are sought to be enforced according to the\r\ncorresponding provisions of the implementation of those treaty\r\nprovisions in the applicable national law. If the standard suite of\r\nrights granted under applicable copyright law includes additional rights\r\nnot granted under this License, such additional rights are deemed to be\r\nincluded in the License; this License is not intended to restrict the\r\nlicense of any rights under applicable law.\r\n\r\n\r\nCreative Commons Notice\r\n\r\nCreative Commons is not a party to this License, and makes no warranty\r\nwhatsoever in connection with the Work.

The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly\r\nmade subject to and limited by the following restrictions:\r\n\r\na. You may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work only under the terms\r\nof this License. You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource\r\nIdentifier (URI) for, this License with every copy of the Work You\r\nDistribute or Publicly Perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on\r\nthe Work that restrict the terms of this License or the ability of the\r\nrecipient of the Work to exercise the rights granted to that recipient\r\nunder the terms of the License. You may not sublicense the Work. You\r\nmust keep intact all notices that refer to this License and to the\r\ndisclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work You Distribute or\r\nPublicly Perform. When You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work, You\r\nmay not impose any effective technological measures on the Work that\r\nrestrict the ability of a recipient of the Work from You to exercise the\r\nrights granted to that recipient under the terms of the License. This\r\nSection 4(a) applies to the Work as incorporated in a Collection, but\r\nthis does not require the Collection apart from the Work itself to be\r\nmade subject to the terms of this License. If You create a Collection,\r\nupon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable,\r\nremove from the Collection any credit as required by Section 4(c), as\r\nrequested.\r\n\r\nb. You may not exercise any of the rights granted to You in Section 3\r\nabove in any manner that is primarily intended for or directed toward\r\ncommercial advantage or private monetary compensation. The exchange of\r\nthe Work for other copyrighted works by means of digital file-sharing or\r\notherwise shall not be considered to be intended for or directed toward\r\ncommercial advantage or private monetary compensation, provided there is\r\nno payment of any monetary compensation in connection with the exchange\r\nof copyrighted works.\r\n\r\nc. If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or Collections, You\r\nmust, unless a request has been made pursuant to Section 4(a), keep\r\nintact all copyright notices for the Work and provide, reasonable to the\r\nmedium or means You are utilizing: (i) the name of the Original Author\r\n(or pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied, and\/or if the Original Author\r\nand\/or Licensor designate another party or parties (e.g., a sponsor\r\ninstitute, publishing entity, journal) for attribution (\"Attribution\r\nParties\") in Licensor's copyright notice, terms of service or by other\r\nreasonable means, the name of such party or parties; (ii) the title of\r\nthe Work if supplied; (iii) to the extent reasonably practicable, the\r\nURI, if any, that Licensor specifies to be associated with the Work,\r\nunless such URI does not refer to the copyright notice or licensing\r\ninformation for the Work. The credit required by this Section 4(c) may\r\nbe implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however, that in the\r\ncase of a Collection, at a minimum such credit will appear, if a credit\r\nfor all contributing authors of Collection appears, then as part of\r\nthese credits and in a manner at least as prominent as the credits for\r\nthe other contributing authors. For the avoidance of doubt, You may only\r\nuse the credit required by this Section for the purpose of attribution\r\nin the manner set out above and, by exercising Your rights under this\r\nLicense, You may not implicitly or explicitly assert or imply any\r\nconnection with, sponsorship or endorsement by the Original Author,\r\nLicensor and\/or Attribution Parties, as appropriate, of You or Your use\r\nof the Work, without the separate, express prior written permission of\r\nthe Original Author, Licensor and\/or Attribution Parties.\r\n\r\nd. For the avoidance of doubt:\r\n\r\ni. Non-waivable Compulsory License Schemes.

Waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in which\r\nthe right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory\r\nlicensing scheme can be waived, the Licensor reserves the exclusive\r\nright to collect such royalties for any exercise by You of the rights\r\ngranted under this License if Your exercise of such rights is for a\r\npurpose or use which is otherwise than noncommercial as permitted under\r\nSection 4(b) and otherwise waives the right to collect royalties through\r\nany statutory or compulsory licensing scheme; and,\r\n\r\niii. Voluntary License Schemes. The Licensor reserves the right to\r\ncollect royalties, whether individually or, in the event that the\r\nLicensor is a member of a collecting society that administers voluntary\r\nlicensing schemes, via that society, from any exercise by You of the\r\nrights granted under this License that is for a purpose or use which is\r\notherwise than noncommercial as permitted under Section 4(b).\r\n\r\ne. Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor or as may be\r\notherwise permitted by applicable law, if You Reproduce, Distribute or\r\nPublicly Perform the Work either by itself or as part of any\r\nCollections, You must not distort, mutilate, modify or take other\r\nderogatory action in relation to the Work which would be prejudicial to\r\nthe Original Author's honor or reputation.\r\n\r\n5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer\r\n\r\nUNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR\r\nOFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY\r\nKIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE,\r\nINCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY,\r\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF\r\nLATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS,\r\nWHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE\r\nEXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\r\n\r\n6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE\r\nLAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR\r\nANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES\r\nARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS\r\nBEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\r\n\r\n7. Termination\r\n\r\na. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate\r\nautomatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this License.\r\nIndividuals or entities who have received Collections from You under\r\nthis License, however, will not have their licenses terminated provided\r\nsuch individuals or entities remain in full compliance with those\r\nlicenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any termination of\r\nthis License.\r\n\r\nb. Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here\r\nis perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work).\r\nNotwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the\r\nWork under different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at\r\nany time; provided, however that any such election will not serve to\r\nwithdraw this License (or any other license that has been, or is\r\nrequired to be, granted under the terms of this License), and this\r\nLicense will continue in full force and effect unless terminated as\r\nstated above.\r\n\r\n8. Miscellaneous\r\n\r\na. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work or a\r\nCollection, the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Work\r\non the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under\r\nthis License.\r\n\r\nb. If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under\r\napplicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of\r\nthe remainder of the terms of this License, and without further action\r\nby the parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to\r\nthe minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and\r\nenforceable.\r\n\r\nc. No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no\r\nbreach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing\r\nand signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or consent.\r\n\r\nd. This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties\r\nwith respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings,\r\nagreements or representations with respect to the Work not specified\r\nhere. Licensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions that may\r\nappear in any communication from You. This License may not be modified\r\nwithout the mutual written agreement of the Licensor and You.\r\n\r\ne. The rights granted under, and the subject matter referenced, in this\r\nLicense were drafted utilizing the terminology of the Berne Convention\r\nfor the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (as amended on\r\nSeptember 28, 1979), the Rome Convention of 1961, the WIPO Copyright\r\nTreaty of 1996, the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty of 1996 and\r\nthe Universal Copyright Convention (as revised on July 24, 1971). These\r\nrights and subject matter take effect in the relevant jurisdiction in\r\nwhich the License terms are sought to be enforced according to the\r\ncorresponding provisions of the implementation of those treaty\r\nprovisions in the applicable national law. If the standard suite of\r\nrights granted under applicable copyright law includes additional rights\r\nnot granted under this License, such additional rights are deemed to be\r\nincluded in the License; this License is not intended to restrict the\r\nlicense of any rights under applicable law.\r\n\r\n\r\nCreative Commons Notice\r\n\r\nCreative Commons is not a party to this License, and makes no warranty\r\nwhatsoever in connection with the Work.

The credit required by this Section \r\n4(c) may be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however, \r\nthat in the case of a Adaptation or Collection, at a minimum such credit \r\nwill appear, if a credit for all contributing authors of the Adaptation \r\nor Collection appears, then as part of these credits and in a manner at \r\nleast as prominent as the credits for the other contributing authors. \r\nFor the avoidance of doubt, You may only use the credit required by this \r\nSection for the purpose of attribution in the manner set out above and, \r\nby exercising Your rights under this License, You may not implicitly or \r\nexplicitly assert or imply any connection with, sponsorship or \r\nendorsement by the Original Author, Licensor and\/or Attribution Parties, \r\nas appropriate, of You or Your use of the Work, without the separate, \r\nexpress prior written permission of the Original Author, Licensor and\/or \r\nAttribution Parties. \r\n\r\nd.

Waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in which \r\nthe right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory \r\nlicensing scheme can be waived, the Licensor reserves the exclusive \r\nright to collect such royalties for any exercise by You of the rights \r\ngranted under this License if Your exercise of such rights is for a \r\npurpose or use which is otherwise than noncommercial as permitted under \r\nSection 4(b) and otherwise waives the right to collect royalties through \r\nany statutory or compulsory licensing scheme; and, \r\n\r\niii. Voluntary License Schemes. The Licensor reserves the right to \r\ncollect royalties, whether individually or, in the event that the \r\nLicensor is a member of a collecting society that administers voluntary \r\nlicensing schemes, via that society, from any exercise by You of the \r\nrights granted under this License that is for a purpose or use which is \r\notherwise than noncommercial as permitted under Section 4(c). \r\n\r\ne. Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor or as may be \r\notherwise permitted by applicable law, if You Reproduce, Distribute or \r\nPublicly Perform the Work either by itself or as part of any Adaptations \r\nor Collections, You must not distort, mutilate, modify or take other \r\nderogatory action in relation to the Work which would be prejudicial to \r\nthe Original Author's honor or reputation. Licensor agrees that in those \r\njurisdictions (e.g. Japan), in which any exercise of the right granted \r\nin Section 3(b) of this License (the right to make Adaptations) would be \r\ndeemed to be a distortion, mutilation, modification or other derogatory \r\naction prejudicial to the Original Author's honor and reputation, the \r\nLicensor will waive or not assert, as appropriate, this Section, to the \r\nfullest extent permitted by the applicable national law, to enable You \r\nto reasonably exercise Your right under Section 3(b) of this License \r\n(right to make Adaptations) but not otherwise. \r\n\r\n5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer \r\n\r\nUNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR \r\nOFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY \r\nKIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, \r\nINCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY, \r\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF \r\nLATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, \r\nWHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE \r\nEXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. \r\n\r\n6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE \r\nLAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR \r\nANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES \r\nARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS \r\nBEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. \r\n\r\n7. Termination \r\n\r\na. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate \r\nautomatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this License. \r\nIndividuals or entities who have received Adaptations or Collections \r\nfrom You under this License, however, will not have their licenses \r\nterminated provided such individuals or entities remain in full \r\ncompliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will \r\nsurvive any termination of this License. \r\n\r\nb. Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here \r\nis perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work). \r\nNotwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the \r\nWork under different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at \r\nany time; provided, however that any such election will not serve to \r\nwithdraw this License (or any other license that has been, or is \r\nrequired to be, granted under the terms of this License), and this \r\nLicense will continue in full force and effect unless terminated as \r\nstated above. \r\n\r\n8. Miscellaneous \r\n\r\na. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work or a \r\nCollection, the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Work \r\non the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under \r\nthis License. \r\n\r\nb. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation, Licensor \r\noffers to the recipient a license to the original Work on the same terms \r\nand conditions as the license granted to You under this License. \r\n\r\nc. If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under \r\napplicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of \r\nthe remainder of the terms of this License, and without further action \r\nby the parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to \r\nthe minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and \r\nenforceable. \r\n\r\nd. No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no \r\nbreach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing \r\nand signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or consent. \r\n\r\ne. This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties \r\nwith respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings, \r\nagreements or representations with respect to the Work not specified \r\nhere. Licensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions that may \r\nappear in any communication from You. This License may not be modified \r\nwithout the mutual written agreement of the Licensor and You. \r\n\r\nf.

These \r\nrights and subject matter take effect in the relevant jurisdiction in \r\nwhich the License terms are sought to be enforced according to the \r\ncorresponding provisions of the implementation of those treaty \r\nprovisions in the applicable national law. If the standard suite of \r\nrights granted under applicable copyright law includes additional rights \r\nnot granted under this License, such additional rights are deemed to be \r\nincluded in the License; this License is not intended to restrict the \r\nlicense of any rights under applicable law. \r\n\r\n\r\nCreative Commons Notice \r\n\r\nCreative Commons is not a party to this License, and makes no warranty \r\nwhatsoever in connection with the Work.

Distribution Obligations. \r\n\r\n3.1. Application of License. \r\nThe Modifications which You contribute are governed by the terms of \r\nthis License, including without limitation Section 2.2. The Source \r\nCode version of Covered Code may be distributed only under the terms \r\nof this License, and You must include a copy of this License with \r\nevery copy of the Source Code You distribute. You may not offer or \r\nimpose any terms on any Source Code version that alters or restricts \r\nthe applicable version of this License or the recipients' rights \r\nhereunder. However, You may include an additional document offering \r\nthe additional rights described in Section 3.5. \r\n\r\n3.2. Availability of Source Code. \r\nAny Modification which You contribute must be made available in Source \r\nCode form under the terms of this License either on the same media as \r\nan Executable version or via an accepted Electronic Distribution \r\nMechanism to anyone to whom you made an Executable version available; \r\nand if made available via Electronic Distribution Mechanism, must \r\nremain available for at least twelve (12) months after the date it \r\ninitially became available, or at least six (6) months after a \r\nsubsequent version of that particular Modification has been made \r\navailable to such recipients.

Description of Modifications. \r\nYou must cause all Covered Code to which you contribute to contain a \r\nfile documenting the changes You made to create that Covered Code and \r\nthe date of any change. You must include a prominent statement that \r\nthe Modification is derived, directly or indirectly, from Original \r\nCode provided by the Initial Developer and including the name of the \r\nInitial Developer in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in any notice in an \r\nExecutable version or related documentation in which You describe the \r\norigin or ownership of the Covered Code. \r\n\r\n3.4. Intellectual Property Matters \r\n\r\n(a) Third Party Claims. \r\nIf You have knowledge that a party claims an intellectual property \r\nright in particular functionality or code (or its utilization \r\nunder this License), you must include a text file with the source \r\ncode distribution titled ``LEGAL'' which describes the claim and \r\nthe party making the claim in sufficient detail that a recipient \r\nwill know whom to contact. If you obtain such knowledge after You \r\nmake Your Modification available as described in Section 3.2, You \r\nshall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies You make \r\navailable thereafter and shall take other steps (such as notifying \r\nappropriate mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably calculated to \r\ninform those who received the Covered Code that new knowledge has \r\nbeen obtained. \r\n\r\n(b) Contributor APIs. \r\nIf Your Modification is an application programming interface and \r\nYou own or control patents which are reasonably necessary to \r\nimplement that API, you must also include this information in the \r\nLEGAL file. \r\n\r\n3.5. Required Notices. \r\nYou must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source \r\nCode, and this License in any documentation for the Source Code, where \r\nYou describe recipients' rights relating to Covered Code. If You \r\ncreated one or more Modification(s), You may add your name as a \r\nContributor to the notice described in Exhibit A. If it is not \r\npossible to put such notice in a particular Source Code file due to \r\nits structure, then you must include such notice in a location (such \r\nas a relevant directory file) where a user would be likely to look for \r\nsuch a notice. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, \r\nwarranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more \r\nrecipients of Covered Code. However, You may do so only on Your own \r\nbehalf, and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any \r\nContributor. You must make it absolutely clear than any such warranty, \r\nsupport, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone, \r\nand You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every \r\nContributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or \r\nsuch Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or \r\nliability terms You offer. \r\n\r\n3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions. \r\nYou may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the \r\nrequirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered Code, \r\nand if You include a notice stating that the Source Code version of \r\nthe Covered Code is available under the terms of this License, \r\nincluding a description of how and where You have fulfilled the \r\nobligations of Section 3.2. The notice must be conspicuously included \r\nin any notice in an Executable version, related documentation or \r\ncollateral in which You describe recipients' rights relating to the \r\nCovered Code. You may distribute the Executable version of Covered \r\nCode under a license of Your choice, which may contain terms different \r\nfrom this License, provided that You are in compliance with the terms \r\nof this License and that the license for the Executable version does \r\nnot attempt to limit or alter the recipient's rights in the Source \r\nCode version from the rights set forth in this License. If You \r\ndistribute the Executable version under a different license You must \r\nmake it absolutely clear that any terms which differ from this License \r\nare offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer or any \r\nContributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and \r\nevery Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer \r\nor such Contributor as a result of any such terms You offer. \r\n\r\n3.7. Larger Works. \r\nYou may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other code \r\nnot governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger \r\nWork as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the \r\nrequirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code. \r\n\r\n4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation. \r\nIf it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this \r\nLicense with respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to statute \r\nor regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License \r\nto the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and \r\nthe code they affect. Such description must be included in the LEGAL \r\nfile described in Section 3.4 and must be included with all \r\ndistributions of the Source Code. Except to the extent prohibited by \r\nstatute or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed \r\nfor a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it. \r\n\r\n5. Application of this License. \r\n\r\nThis License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has \r\nattached the notice in Exhibit A, and to related Covered Code. \r\n\r\n6. CONNECTION TO MOZILLA PUBLIC LICENSE \r\n\r\nThis Erlang License is a derivative work of the Mozilla Public \r\nLicense, Version 1.0. It contains terms which differ from the Mozilla \r\nPublic License, Version 1.0. \r\n\r\n7.

DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY \r\nAny utilization of Covered Code shall not cause the Initial Developer \r\nor any Contributor to be liable for any damages (neither direct nor \r\nindirect). \r\n\r\n10. MISCELLANEOUS \r\nThis License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject \r\nmatter hereof.

Any use of the Work, other \r\nthan as authorised under this Licence is prohibited (to the extent such use is covered by a right \r\nof the copyright holder of the Work). \r\n\r\nThe Original Work is provided under the terms of this Licence when the Licensor (as defined \r\nbelow) has placed the following notice immediately following the copyright notice for the \r\n\r\nOriginal Work: \r\nLicensed under the EUPL V.1.0 \r\nor has expressed by any other mean his willingness to license under the EUPL. \r\n\r\n1. Definitions \r\n\r\nIn this Licence, the following terms have the following meaning: \r\n\r\n\u2212 The Licence: this Licence. \r\n\r\n\u2212 The Original Work or the Software: the software distributed and\/or communicated by \r\nthe Licensor under this Licence, available as Source Code and also as Executable \r\nCode as the case may be. \r\n\r\n\u2212 Derivative Works: the works or software that could be created by the Licensee, based \r\nupon the Original Work or modifications thereof. This Licence does not define the \r\nextent of modification or dependence on the Original Work required in order to \r\nclassify a work as a Derivative Work; this extent is determined by copyright law \r\napplicable in the country mentioned in Article 15. \r\n\r\n\u2212 The Work: the Original Work and\/or its Derivative Works. \r\n\r\n\u2212 The Source Code: the human-readable form of the Work which is the most \r\nconvenient for people to study and modify. \r\n\r\n\u2212 The Executable Code: any code which has generally been compiled and which is \r\nmeant to be interpreted by a computer as a program. \r\n\r\n\u2212 The Licensor: the natural or legal person that distributes and\/or communicates the \r\nWork under the Licence. \r\n\r\n\u2212 Contributor(s): any natural or legal person who modifies the Work under the \r\nLicence, or otherwise contributes to the creation of a Derivative Work. \r\n\r\n\u2212 The Licensee or \u201cYou\u201d: any natural or legal person who makes any usage of the \r\nSoftware under the terms of the Licence. \u2212 Distribution and\/or Communication: any act of selling, giving, lending, renting, distributing, communicating, transmitting, or otherwise making available, on-line or \r\noff-line, copies of the Work at the disposal of any other natural or legal person. \r\n\r\n2. Scope of the rights granted by the Licence \r\n\r\nThe Licensor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, sub-licensable \r\nlicence to do the following, for the duration of copyright vested in the Original Work: \r\n\r\n\u2212 use the Work in any circumstance and for all usage, \r\n\u2212 reproduce the Work, \r\n\u2212 modify the Original Work, and make Derivative Works based upon the Work, \r\n\u2212 communicate to the public, including the right to make available or display the Work \r\nor copies thereof to the public and perform publicly, as the case may be, the Work, \r\n\u2212 distribute the Work or copies thereof, \r\n\u2212 lend and rent the Work or copies thereof, \r\n\u2212 sub-license rights in the Work or copies thereof. \r\n\r\nThose rights can be exercised on any media, supports and formats, whether now known or \r\nlater invented, as far as the applicable law permits so. \r\n\r\nIn the countries where moral rights apply, the Licensor waives his right to exercise his moral \r\nright to the extent allowed by law in order to make effective the licence of the economic rights \r\nhere above listed. \r\n\r\nThe Licensor grants to the Licensee royalty-free, non exclusive usage rights to any patents \r\nheld by the Licensor, to the extent necessary to make use of the rights granted on the Work \r\nunder this Licence. \r\n\r\n3. Communication of the Source Code \r\n\r\nThe Licensor may provide the Work either in its Source Code form, or as Executable Code. If \r\nthe Work is provided as Executable Code, the Licensor provides in addition a machinereadable copy of the Source Code of the Work along with each copy of the Work that the \r\nLicensor distributes or indicates, in a notice following the copyright notice attached to the \r\nWork, a repository where the Source Code is easily and freely accessible for as long as the \r\nLicensor continues to distribute and\/or communicate the Work. \r\n\r\n4. Limitations on copyright \r\n\r\nNothing in this Licence is intended to deprive the Licensee of the benefits from any exception \r\nor limitation to the exclusive rights of the rights owners in the Original Work or Software, of \r\nthe exhaustion of those rights or of other applicable limitations thereto. \r\n\r\n5. Obligations of the Licensee \r\n\r\nThe grant of the rights mentioned above is subject to some restrictions and obligations \r\nimposed on the Licensee. Those obligations are the following: \r\n\r\nAttribution right: the Licensee shall keep intact all copyright, patent or trademarks notices \r\nand all notices that refer to the Licence and to the disclaimer of warranties. The Licensee must \r\ninclude a copy of such notices and a copy of the Licence with every copy of the Work he\/she \r\ndistributes and\/or communicates. The Licensee must cause any Derivative Work to carry \r\nprominent notices stating that the Work has been modified and the date of modification. \r\n\r\nCopyleft clause: If the Licensee distributes and\/or communicates copies of the Original \r\nWorks or Derivative Works based upon the Original Work, this Distribution and\/or \r\nCommunication will be done under the terms of this Licence. The Licensee (becoming \r\nLicensor) cannot offer or impose any additional terms or conditions on the Work or \r\nDerivative Work that alter or restrict the terms of the Licence. \r\n\r\nCompatibility clause: If the Licensee Distributes and\/or Communicates Derivative Works or \r\ncopies thereof based upon both the Original Work and another work licensed under a \r\nCompatible Licence, this Distribution and\/or Communication can be done under the terms of \r\nthis Compatible Licence. For the sake of this clause, \u201cCompatible Licence\u201d refers to the \r\nlicences listed in the appendix attached to this Licence. Should the Licensee\u2019s obligations \r\nunder the Compatible Licence conflict with his\/her obligations under this Licence, the \r\nobligations of the Compatible Licence shall prevail. \r\n\r\nProvision of Source Code: When distributing and\/or communicating copies of the Work, the \r\nLicensee will provide a machine-readable copy of the Source Code or indicate a repository \r\nwhere this Source will be easily and freely available for as long as the Licensee continues to \r\ndistribute and\/or communicate the Work. \r\n\r\nLegal Protection: This Licence does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks, \r\nservice marks, or names of the Licensor, except as required for reasonable and customary use \r\nin describing the origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the copyright notice. \r\n\r\n6. Chain of Authorship \r\n\r\nThe original Licensor warrants that the copyright in the Original Work granted hereunder is \r\nowned by him\/her or licensed to him\/her and that he\/she has the power and authority to grant \r\nthe Licence. \r\n\r\nEach Contributor warrants that the copyright in the modifications he\/she brings to the Work \r\nare owned by him\/her or licensed to him\/her and that he\/she has the power and authority to \r\ngrant the Licence. \r\n\r\nEach time You, as a Licensee, receive the Work, the original Licensor and subsequent \r\nContributors grant You a licence to their contributions to the Work, under the terms of this \r\nLicence. \r\n\r\n7. Disclaimer of Warranty \r\n\r\nThe Work is a work in progress, which is continuously improved by numerous contributors. It \r\nis not a finished work and may therefore contain defects or \u201cbugs\u201d inherent to this type of \r\nsoftware development. \r\n\r\nFor the above reason, the Work is provided under the Licence on an \u201cas is\u201d basis and without \r\nwarranties of any kind concerning the Work, including without limitation merchantability, \r\nfitness for a particular purpose, absence of defects or errors, accuracy, non-infringement of \r\nintellectual property rights other than copyright as stated in Article 6 of this Licence. \r\n\r\nThis disclaimer of warranty is an essential part of the Licence and a condition for the grant of \r\nany rights to the Work. \r\n\r\n8. Disclaimer of Liability \r\n\r\nExcept in the cases of wilful misconduct or damages directly caused to natural persons, the \r\nLicensor will in no event be liable for any direct or indirect, material or moral, damages of \r\nany kind, arising out of the Licence or of the use of the Work, including without limitation, \r\ndamages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, loss of data or \r\nany commercial damage, even if the Licensor has been advised of the possibility of such \r\ndamage. However, the Licensor will be liable under statutory product liability laws as far such \r\nlaws apply to the Work. \r\n\r\n9. Additional agreements \r\n\r\nWhile distributing the Original Work or Derivative Works, You may choose to conclude an \r\nadditional agreement to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, \r\nindemnity, or other liability obligations and\/or services consistent with this Licence. \r\nHowever, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on your own behalf and on your \r\nsole responsibility, not on behalf of the original Licensor or any other Contributor, and only if \r\nYou agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred \r\nby, or claims asserted against such Contributor by the fact You have accepted any such \r\nwarranty or additional liability. \r\n\r\n10. Acceptance of the Licence \r\n\r\nThe provisions of this Licence can be accepted by clicking on an icon \u201cI agree\u201d placed under \r\nthe bottom of a window displaying the text of this Licence or by affirming consent in any \r\nother similar way, in accordance with the rules of applicable law. Clicking on that icon \r\nindicates your clear and irrevocable acceptance of this Licence and all of its terms and \r\nconditions. \r\n\r\nSimilarly, you irrevocably accept this Licence and all of its terms and conditions by \r\nexercising any rights granted to You by Article 2 of this Licence, such as the use of the Work, \r\nthe creation by You of a Derivative Work or the Distribution and\/or Communication by You \r\nof the Work or copies thereof. \r\n\r\n11. Information to the public \r\n\r\nIn case of any Distribution and\/or Communication of the Work by means of electronic \r\ncommunication by You (for example, by offering to download the Work from a remote \r\nlocation) the distribution channel or media (for example, a website) must at least provide to \r\nthe public the information requested by the applicable law regarding the identification and \r\naddress of the Licensor, the Licence and the way it may be accessible, concluded, stored and \r\nreproduced by the Licensee. \r\n\r\n12. Termination of the Licence \r\n\r\nThe Licence and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically upon any breach by \r\nthe Licensee of the terms of the Licence. \r\n\r\nSuch a termination will not terminate the licences of any person who has received the Work \r\nfrom the Licensee under the Licence, provided such persons remain in full compliance with \r\nthe Licence. \r\n\r\n13. Miscellaneous \r\n\r\nWithout prejudice of Article 9 above, the Licence represents the complete agreement between \r\nthe Parties as to the Work licensed hereunder. \r\n\r\nIf any provision of the Licence is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, this will not \r\naffect the validity or enforceability of the Licence as a whole. Such provision will be \r\nconstrued and\/or reformed so as necessary to make it valid and enforceable. \r\n\r\nThe European Commission may put into force translations and\/or binding new versions of \r\nthis Licence, so far this is required and reasonable. New versions of the Licence will be \r\npublished with a unique version number. The new version of the Licence becomes binding for \r\nYou as soon as You become aware of its publication. \r\n\r\n14. Jurisdiction \r\n\r\nAny litigation resulting from the interpretation of this License, arising between the European \r\nCommission, as a Licensor, and any Licensee, will be subject to the jurisdiction of the Court \r\nof Justice of the European Communities, as laid down in article 238 of the Treaty establishing \r\nthe European Community. \r\n\r\nAny litigation arising between Parties, other than the European Commission, and resulting \r\nfrom the interpretation of this License, will be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the \r\ncompetent court where the Licensor resides or conducts its primary business. \r\n\r\n15. Applicable Law \r\n\r\nThis Licence shall be governed by the law of the European Union country where the Licensor \r\nresides or has his registered office. \r\n\r\nThis licence shall be governed by the Belgian law if: \r\n\r\n\u2212 a litigation arises between the European Commission, as a Licensor, and any \r\nLicensee; \r\n\r\n\u2212 the Licensor, other than the European Commission, has no residence or registered \r\noffice inside a European Union country. \r\n\r\n=== \r\n\r\nAppendix \r\n\r\n\u201cCompatible Licences\u201d according to article 5 EUPL are: \r\n\r\n\u2212 General Public License (GPL) v. 2 \r\n\u2212 Open Software License (OSL) v. 2.1, v. 3.0 \r\n\u2212 Common Public License v. 1.0 \r\n\u2212 Eclipse Public License v. 1.0 \r\n\u2212 Cecill v. 2.0",

Definitions \r\n\r\nIn this Licence, the following terms have the following meaning: \r\n\r\n- The Licence: this Licence. \r\n\r\n- The Original Work or the Software: the software distributed and\/or communicated \r\nby the Licensor under this Licence, available as Source Code and also as Executable \r\nCode as the case may be. \r\n\r\n- Derivative Works: the works or software that could be created by the Licensee, \r\nbased upon the Original Work or modifications thereof. This Licence does not define \r\nthe extent of modification or dependence on the Original Work required in order to \r\nclassify a work as a Derivative Work; this extent is determined by copyright law \r\napplicable in the country mentioned in Article 15. \r\n\r\n- The Work: the Original Work and\/or its Derivative Works. \r\n\r\n- The Source Code: the human-readable form of the Work which is the most \r\nconvenient for people to study and modify. \r\n\r\n- The Executable Code: any code which has generally been compiled and which is \r\nmeant to be interpreted by a computer as a program. \r\n\r\n- The Licensor: the natural or legal person that distributes and\/or communicates the \r\nWork under the Licence. \r\n\r\n- Contributor(s): any natural or legal person who modifies the Work under the \r\nLicence, or otherwise contributes to the creation of a Derivative Work. \r\n\r\n- The Licensee or \"You\": any natural or legal person who makes any usage of the \r\nSoftware under the terms of the Licence. \r\n\r\n- Distribution and\/or Communication: any act of selling, giving, lending, renting, \r\ndistributing, communicating, transmitting, or otherwise making available, on-line or \r\noff-line, copies of the Work or providing access to its essential functionalities at the \r\ndisposal of any other natural or legal person. \r\n\r\n2. Scope of the rights granted by the Licence \r\n\r\nThe Licensor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, sublicensable \r\nlicence to do the following, for the duration of copyright vested in the \r\nOriginal Work: \r\n\r\n- use the Work in any circumstance and for all usage, \r\n- reproduce the Work, \r\n- modify the Original Work, and make Derivative Works based upon the Work, \r\n- communicate to the public, including the right to make available or display the \r\nWork or copies thereof to the public and perform publicly, as the case may be, \r\nthe Work, \r\n- distribute the Work or copies thereof, \r\n- lend and rent the Work or copies thereof, \r\n- sub-license rights in the Work or copies thereof. \r\n\r\nThose rights can be exercised on any media, supports and formats, whether now \r\nknown or later invented, as far as the applicable law permits so. \r\n\r\nIn the countries where moral rights apply, the Licensor waives his right to exercise his \r\nmoral right to the extent allowed by law in order to make effective the licence of the \r\neconomic rights here above listed. \r\n\r\nThe Licensor grants to the Licensee royalty-free, non exclusive usage rights to any \r\npatents held by the Licensor, to the extent necessary to make use of the rights granted \r\non the Work under this Licence. \r\n\r\n3. Communication of the Source Code \r\n\r\nThe Licensor may provide the Work either in its Source Code form, or as Executable \r\nCode. If the Work is provided as Executable Code, the Licensor provides in addition a \r\nmachine-readable copy of the Source Code of the Work along with each copy of the \r\nWork that the Licensor distributes or indicates, in a notice following the copyright \r\nnotice attached to the Work, a repository where the Source Code is easily and freely \r\naccessible for as long as the Licensor continues to distribute and\/or communicate the \r\nWork. \r\n\r\n4. Limitations on copyright \r\n\r\nNothing in this Licence is intended to deprive the Licensee of the benefits from any \r\nexception or limitation to the exclusive rights of the rights owners in the Original \r\nWork or Software, of the exhaustion of those rights or of other applicable limitations \r\nthereto. \r\n\r\n5. Obligations of the Licensee \r\n\r\nThe grant of the rights mentioned above is subject to some restrictions and obligations \r\nimposed on the Licensee. Those obligations are the following: \r\n\r\nAttribution right: the Licensee shall keep intact all copyright, patent or trademarks \r\nnotices and all notices that refer to the Licence and to the disclaimer of warranties. \r\nThe Licensee must include a copy of such notices and a copy of the Licence with \r\nevery copy of the Work he\/she distributes and\/or communicates. The Licensee must \r\ncause any Derivative Work to carry prominent notices stating that the Work has been \r\nmodified and the date of modification. \r\n\r\nCopyleft clause: If the Licensee distributes and\/or communicates copies of the \r\nOriginal Works or Derivative Works based upon the Original Work, this Distribution \r\nand\/or Communication will be done under the terms of this Licence or of a later \r\nversion of this Licence unless the Original Work is expressly distributed only under \r\nthis version of the Licence. The Licensee (becoming Licensor) cannot offer or impose \r\nany additional terms or conditions on the Work or Derivative Work that alter or \r\nrestrict the terms of the Licence. \r\n\r\nCompatibility clause: If the Licensee Distributes and\/or Communicates Derivative \r\nWorks or copies thereof based upon both the Original Work and another work \r\nlicensed under a Compatible Licence, this Distribution and\/or Communication can be \r\ndone under the terms of this Compatible Licence. For the sake of this clause, \r\n\"Compatible Licence\ufffd\" refers to the licences listed in the appendix attached to this \r\nLicence. Should the Licensee\u2019s obligations under the Compatible Licence conflict \r\nwith his\/her obligations under this Licence, the obligations of the Compatible Licence \r\nshall prevail. \r\n\r\nProvision of Source Code: When distributing and\/or communicating copies of the \r\nWork, the Licensee will provide a machine-readable copy of the Source Code or \r\nindicate a repository where this Source will be easily and freely available for as long \r\nas the Licensee continues to distribute and\/or communicate the Work. \r\n\r\nLegal Protection: This Licence does not grant permission to use the trade names, \r\ntrademarks, service marks, or names of the Licensor, except as required for \r\nreasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Work and reproducing \r\nthe content of the copyright notice. \r\n\r\n6. Chain of Authorship \r\n\r\nThe original Licensor warrants that the copyright in the Original Work granted \r\nhereunder is owned by him\/her or licensed to him\/her and that he\/she has the power \r\nand authority to grant the Licence. \r\n\r\nEach Contributor warrants that the copyright in the modifications he\/she brings to the \r\nWork are owned by him\/her or licensed to him\/her and that he\/she has the power and \r\nauthority to grant the Licence. \r\n\r\nEach time You accept the Licence, the original Licensor and subsequent Contributors \r\ngrant You a licence to their contributions to the Work, under the terms of this \r\nLicence. \r\n\r\n7. Disclaimer of Warranty \r\n\r\nThe Work is a work in progress, which is continuously improved by numerous \r\ncontributors. It is not a finished work and may therefore contain defects or \"bugs\" \r\ninherent to this type of software development. \r\n\r\nFor the above reason, the Work is provided under the Licence on an \"as is\" basis and \r\nwithout warranties of any kind concerning the Work, including without limitation \r\nmerchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, absence of defects or errors, \r\naccuracy, non-infringement of intellectual property rights other than copyright as \r\nstated in Article 6 of this Licence. \r\n\r\nThis disclaimer of warranty is an essential part of the Licence and a condition for the \r\ngrant of any rights to the Work. \r\n\r\n8. Disclaimer of Liability \r\n\r\nExcept in the cases of wilful misconduct or damages directly caused to natural \r\npersons, the Licensor will in no event be liable for any direct or indirect, material or \r\nmoral, damages of any kind, arising out of the Licence or of the use of the Work, \r\nincluding without limitation, damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer \r\nfailure or malfunction, loss of data or any commercial damage, even if the Licensor \r\nhas been advised of the possibility of such damage. However, the Licensor will be \r\nliable under statutory product liability laws as far such laws apply to the Work. \r\n\r\n9. Additional agreements \r\n\r\nWhile distributing the Original Work or Derivative Works, You may choose to \r\nconclude an additional agreement to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, \r\nwarranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and\/or services consistent with this \r\nLicence. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on your own \r\nbehalf and on your sole responsibility, not on behalf of the original Licensor or any \r\nother Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each \r\nContributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against such \r\nContributor by the fact You have accepted any such warranty or additional liability. \r\n\r\n10. Acceptance of the Licence \r\n\r\nThe provisions of this Licence can be accepted by clicking on an icon \"I agree\" \r\nplaced under the bottom of a window displaying the text of this Licence or by \r\naffirming consent in any other similar way, in accordance with the rules of applicable \r\nlaw. Clicking on that icon indicates your clear and irrevocable acceptance of this \r\nLicence and all of its terms and conditions. \r\n\r\nSimilarly, you irrevocably accept this Licence and all of its terms and conditions by \r\nexercising any rights granted to You by Article 2 of this Licence, such as the use of \r\nthe Work, the creation by You of a Derivative Work or the Distribution and\/or \r\nCommunication by You of the Work or copies thereof. \r\n\r\n11. Information to the public \r\n\r\nIn case of any Distribution and\/or Communication of the Work by means of electronic \r\ncommunication by You (for example, by offering to download the Work from a \r\nremote location) the distribution channel or media (for example, a website) must at \r\nleast provide to the public the information requested by the applicable law regarding \r\nthe Licensor, the Licence and the way it may be accessible, concluded, stored and \r\nreproduced by the Licensee. \r\n\r\n12. Termination of the Licence \r\n\r\nThe Licence and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically upon any \r\nbreach by the Licensee of the terms of the Licence. \r\nSuch a termination will not terminate the licences of any person who has received the \r\nWork from the Licensee under the Licence, provided such persons remain in full \r\ncompliance with the Licence. \r\n\r\n13. Miscellaneous \r\n\r\nWithout prejudice of Article 9 above, the Licence represents the complete agreement \r\nbetween the Parties as to the Work licensed hereunder. \r\n\r\nIf any provision of the Licence is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, this \r\nwill not affect the validity or enforceability of the Licence as a whole. Such provision \r\nwill be construed and\/or reformed so as necessary to make it valid and enforceable. \r\n\r\nThe European Commission may publish other linguistic versions and\/or new versions \r\nof this Licence, so far this is required and reasonable, without reducing the scope of \r\nthe rights granted by the Licence. New versions of the Licence will be published with \r\na unique version number. \r\n\r\nAll linguistic versions of this Licence, approved by the European Commission, have \r\nidentical value. Parties can take advantage of the linguistic version of their choice. \r\n\r\n14. Jurisdiction \r\n\r\nAny litigation resulting from the interpretation of this License, arising between the \r\nEuropean Commission, as a Licensor, and any Licensee, will be subject to the \r\njurisdiction of the Court of Justice of the European Communities, as laid down in \r\narticle 238 of the Treaty establishing the European Community. \r\n\r\nAny litigation arising between Parties, other than the European Commission, and \r\nresulting from the interpretation of this License, will be subject to the exclusive \r\njurisdiction of the competent court where the Licensor resides or conducts its primary \r\nbusiness. \r\n\r\n15. Applicable Law \r\n\r\nThis Licence shall be governed by the law of the European Union country where the \r\nLicensor resides or has his registered office. \r\n\r\nThis licence shall be governed by the Belgian law if: \r\n\r\n- a litigation arises between the European Commission, as a Licensor, and any \r\nLicensee; \r\n- the Licensor, other than the European Commission, has no residence or \r\nregistered office inside a European Union country. \r\n\r\n=== \r\n\r\nAppendix \r\n\r\n\"Compatible Licences\" according to article 5 EUPL are: \r\n- GNU General Public License (GNU GPL) v. 2 \r\n- Open Software License (OSL) v. 2.1, v. 3.0 \r\n- Common Public License v. 1.0 \r\n- Eclipse Public License v. 1.0 \r\n- Cecill v. 2.0",

Permitted Uses; Conditions & Restrictions.Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, Sybase hereby grants You, effective on the date You accept this License and download the Original Code, a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive license, to the extent of Sybase's Applicable Patent Rights and copyrights covering the Original Code, to do the following: \r\n\r\n\r\n2.1 You may use, reproduce, display, perform, modify and distribute Original Code, with or without Modifications, solely for Your internal research and development and\/or Personal Use, provided that in each instance: \r\n\r\n(a) You must retain and reproduce in all copies of Original Code the copyright and other proprietary notices and disclaimers of Sybase as they appear in the Original Code, and keep intact all notices in the Original Code that refer to this License; and \r\n\r\n(b) You must retain and reproduce a copy of this License with every copy of Source Code of Covered Code and documentation You distribute, and You may not offer or impose any terms on such Source Code that alter or restrict this License or the recipients' rights hereunder, except as permitted under Section 6. \r\n\r\n(c) Whenever reasonably feasible you should include the copy of this License in a click-wrap format, which requires affirmative acceptance by clicking on an \"I accept\" button or similar mechanism. If a click-wrap format is not included, you must include a statement that any use (including without limitation reproduction, modification or distribution) of the Software, and any other affirmative act that you define, constitutes acceptance of the License, and instructing the user not to use the Covered Code in any manner if the user does not accept all of the terms and conditions of the License. \r\n\r\n\r\n2.2 You may use, reproduce, display, perform, modify and Deploy Covered Code, provided that in each instance: \r\n\r\n(a) You must satisfy all the conditions of Section 2.1 with respect to the Source Code of the Covered Code; \r\n\r\n(b) You must duplicate, to the extent it does not already exist, the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source Code of all Your Modifications, and cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that You changed the files and the date of any change; \r\n\r\n(c) You must make Source Code of all Your Deployed Modifications publicly available under the terms of this License, including the license grants set forth in Section 3 below, for as long as you Deploy the Covered Code or twelve (12) months from the date of initial Deployment, whichever is longer. You should preferably distribute the Source Code of Your Deployed Modifications electronically (e.g. download from a web site); \r\n\r\n(d) if You Deploy Covered Code in object code, executable form only, You must include a prominent notice, in the code itself as well as in related documentation, stating that Source Code of the Covered Code is available under the terms of this License with information on how and where to obtain such Source Code; and \r\n\r\n(e) the object code form of the Covered Code may be distributed under Your own license agreement, provided that such license agreement contains terms no less protective of Sybase and each Contributor than the terms of this License, and stating that any provisions which differ from this License are offered by You alone and not by any other party. \r\n\r\n\r\n2.3 You expressly acknowledge and agree that although Sybase and each Contributor grants the licenses to their respective portions of the Covered Code set forth herein, no assurances are provided by Sybase or any Contributor that the Covered Code does not infringe the patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity. Sybase and each Contributor disclaim any liability to You for claims brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, You hereby assume sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party patent license is required to allow You to distribute the Covered Code, it is Your responsibility to acquire that license before distributing the Covered Code. \r\n\r\n\r\n3. Your Grants. In consideration of, and as a condition to, the licenses granted to You under this License, You hereby grant to Sybase and all third parties a non-exclusive, royalty-free license, under Your Applicable Patent Rights and other intellectual property rights (other than patent) owned or controlled by You, to use, reproduce, display, perform, modify, distribute and Deploy Your Modifications of the same scope and extent as Sybase's licenses under Sections 2.1 and 2.2. \r\n\r\n\r\n4. Larger Works. You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other code not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In each such instance, You must make sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code or any portion thereof. \r\n\r\n\r\n5. Limitations on Patent License. Except as expressly stated in Section 2, no other patent rights, express or implied, are granted by Sybase herein. Modifications and\/or Larger Works may require additional patent licenses from Sybase which Sybase may grant in its sole discretion. \r\n\r\n\r\n6. Additional Terms. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations and\/or other rights consistent with this License (\"Additional Terms\") to one or more recipients of Covered Code. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf and as Your sole responsibility, and not on behalf of Sybase or any Contributor. You must obtain the recipient's agreement that any such Additional Terms are offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify, defend and hold Sybase and every Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by or claims asserted against Sybase or such Contributor by reason of any such Additional Terms. \r\n\r\n\r\n7. Versions of the License. Sybase may publish revised and\/or new versions of this License from time to time. Each version will be given a distinguishing version number. Once Original Code has been published under a particular version of this License, You may continue to use it under the terms of that version. You may also choose to use such Original Code under the terms of any subsequent version of this License published by Sybase. No one other than Sybase has the right to modify the terms applicable to Covered Code created under this License. \r\n\r\n\r\n8. NO WARRANTY OR SUPPORT. The Covered Code may contain in whole or in part pre-release, untested, or not fully tested works. The Covered Code may contain errors that could cause failures or loss of data, and may be incomplete or contain inaccuracies. You expressly acknowledge and agree that use of the Covered Code, or any portion thereof, is at Your sole and entire risk. THE COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\" AND WITHOUT WARRANTY, UPGRADES OR SUPPORT OF ANY KIND AND SYBASE AND SYBASE'S LICENSOR(S) (COLLECTIVELY REFERRED TO AS \"SYBASE\" FOR THE PURPOSES OF SECTIONS 8 AND 9) AND ALL CONTRIBUTORS EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES AND\/OR CONDITIONS, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES AND\/OR CONDITIONS OF MERCHANTABILITY, OF SATISFACTORY QUALITY, OF FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OF ACCURACY, OF QUIET ENJOYMENT, AND NONINFRINGEMENT OF THIRD PARTY RIGHTS. SYBASE AND EACH CONTRIBUTOR DOES NOT WARRANT AGAINST INTERFERENCE WITH YOUR ENJOYMENT OF THE COVERED CODE, THAT THE FUNCTIONS CONTAINED IN THE COVERED CODE WILL MEET YOUR REQUIREMENTS, THAT THE OPERATION OF THE COVERED CODE WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR-FREE, OR THAT DEFECTS IN THE COVERED CODE WILL BE CORRECTED. NO ORAL OR WRITTEN INFORMATION OR ADVICE GIVEN BY SYBASE, A SYBASE AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE OR ANY CONTRIBUTOR SHALL CREATE A WARRANTY. You acknowledge that the Covered Code is not intended for use in the operation of nuclear facilities, aircraft navigation, communication systems, or air traffic control machines in which case the failure of the Covered Code could lead to death, personal injury, or severe physical or environmental damage. \r\n\r\n\r\n9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. TO THE EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL SYBASE OR ANY CONTRIBUTOR BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL OR OTHER DAMAGES OF ANY KIND ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS LICENSE OR YOUR USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE COVERED CODE, OR ANY PORTION THEREOF, WHETHER UNDER A THEORY OF CONTRACT, WARRANTY, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), PRODUCTS LIABILITY OR OTHERWISE, EVEN IF SYBASE OR SUCH CONTRIBUTOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES, AND NOTWITHSTANDING THE FAILURE OF ESSENTIAL PURPOSE OF ANY REMEDY. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE LIMITATION OF LIABILITY OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL OR OTHER DAMAGES OF ANY KIND, SO THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. In no event shall Sybase's or any Contributor's total liability to You for all damages (other than as may be required by applicable law) under this License exceed the amount of five hundred dollars ($500.00). \r\n\r\n\r\n10. Trademarks. This License does not grant any rights to use the trademarks or trade names \"Sybase\" or any other trademarks or trade names belonging to Sybase (collectively \"Sybase Marks\") or to any trademark or trade name belonging to any Contributor(\"Contributor Marks\"). No Sybase Marks or Contributor Marks may be used to endorse or promote products derived from the Original Code or Covered Code other than with the prior written consent of Sybase or the Contributor, as applicable. \r\n\r\n\r\n11. Ownership. Subject to the licenses granted under this License, each Contributor retains all rights, title and interest in and to any Modifications made by such Contributor. Sybase retains all rights, title and interest in and to the Original Code and any Modifications made by or on behalf of Sybase (\"Sybase Modifications\"), and such Sybase Modifications will not be automatically subject to this License. Sybase may, at its sole discretion, choose to license such Sybase Modifications under this License, or on different terms from those contained in this License or may choose not to license them at all. \r\n\r\n12. Termination. \r\n\r\n\r\n12.1 Termination. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate: \r\n\r\n(a) automatically without notice if You fail to comply with any term(s) of this License and fail to cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of such breach; \r\n\r\n(b) immediately in the event of the circumstances described in Section 13.5(b); or \r\n\r\n(c) automatically without notice if You, at any time during the term of this License, commence an action for patent infringement (including as a cross claim or counterclaim) against Sybase or any Contributor. \r\n\r\n\r\n12.2 Effect of Termination. Upon termination, You agree to immediately stop any further use, reproduction, modification, sublicensing and distribution of the Covered Code and to destroy all copies of the Covered Code that are in your possession or control. All sublicenses to the Covered Code that have been properly granted prior to termination shall survive any termination of this License. Provisions which, by their nature, should remain in effect beyond the termination of this License shall survive, including but not limited to Sections 3, 5, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12.2 and 13. No party will be liable to any other for compensation, indemnity or damages of any sort solely as a result of terminating this License in accordance with its terms, and termination of this License will be without prejudice to any other right or remedy of any party. \r\n\r\n\r\n13. Miscellaneous. \r\n\r\n\r\n13.1 Government End Users. The Covered Code is a \"commercial item\" as defined in FAR 2.101. Government software and technical data rights in the Covered Code include only those rights customarily provided to the public as defined in this License. This customary commercial license in technical data and software is provided in accordance with FAR 12.211 (Technical Data) and 12.212 (Computer Software) and, for Department of Defense purchases, DFAR 252.227-7015 (Technical Data -- Commercial Items) and 227.7202-3 (Rights in Commercial Computer Software or Computer Software Documentation). Accordingly, all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Code with only those rights set forth herein. \r\n\r\n\r\n13.2 Relationship of Parties. This License will not be construed as creating an agency, partnership, joint venture or any other form of legal association between or among you, Sybase or any Contributor, and You will not represent to the contrary, whether expressly, by implication, appearance or otherwise. \r\n\r\n\r\n13.3 Independent Development. Nothing in this License will impair Sybase's or any Contributor's right to acquire, license, develop, have others develop for it, market and\/or distribute technology or products that perform the same or similar functions as, or otherwise compete with, Modifications, Larger Works, technology or products that You may develop, produce, market or distribute. \r\n\r\n\r\n13.4 Waiver; Construction. Failure by Sybase or any Contributor to enforce any provision of this License will not be deemed a waiver of future enforcement of that or any other provision. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter will not apply to this License. \r\n\r\n\r\n13.5 Severability. (a) If for any reason a court of competent jurisdiction finds any provision of this License, or portion thereof, to be unenforceable, that provision of the License will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible so as to effect the economic benefits and intent of the parties, and the remainder of this License will continue in full force and effect. (b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if applicable law prohibits or restricts You from fully and\/or specifically complying with Sections 2 and\/or 3 or prevents the enforceability of either of those Sections, this License will immediately terminate and You must immediately discontinue any use of the Covered Code and destroy all copies of it that are in your possession or control. \r\n\r\n\r\n13.6 Dispute Resolution. Any litigation or other dispute resolution between You and Sybase relating to this License shall take place in the Northern District of California, and You and Sybase hereby consent to the personal jurisdiction of, and venue in, the state and federal courts within that District with respect to this License. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. \r\n\r\n\r\n13.7 Entire Agreement; Governing Law. This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof. This License shall be governed by the laws of the United States and the State of California, except that body of California law concerning conflicts of law. \r\nWhere You are located in the province of Quebec, Canada, the following clause applies: The parties hereby confirm that they have requested that this License and all related documents be drafted in English. Les parties ont exig\u00e8 que le pr\u00e8sent contrat et tous les documents connexes soient r\u00e8di\u00e8s en anglais. \r\n\r\n\r\nEXHIBIT A. \r\n\r\n\"Portions Copyright (c) 1983-2002 Sybase, Inc.

By using the Software, you, an individual or an entity (\"You\") agree to the terms of this Agreement. \r\n\r\nIn consideration of the mutual promises and upon the terms and conditions set forth below, the parties agree as follows: \r\n\r\n1. Grant of Copyright License \r\n1.1 - Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, VMware hereby grants to You, under any and all of its copyright interest in and to the Software, a royalty-free, non-exclusive, non-transferable license to copy, modify, compile, execute, and distribute the Software and Modifications. For the purposes of this Agreement, any change to, addition to, or abridgement of the Software made by You is a \"Modification;\" however, any file You add to the Software that does not contain any part of the Software is not a \"Modification.\" \r\n1.2 - If You are an individual acting on behalf of a corporation or other entity, Your use of the Software or any Modification is subject to Your having the authority to bind such corporation or entity to this Agreement. Providing copies to persons within such corporation or entity is not considered distribution for purposes of this Agreement. \r\n1.3 - For the Software or any Modification You distribute in source code format, You must do so only under the terms of this Agreement, and You must include a complete copy of this Agreement with Your distribution. With respect to any Modification You distribute in source code format, the terms of this Agreement will apply to You in the same way those terms apply to VMware with respect to the Software. In other words, when You are distributing Modifications under this Agreement, You \"stand in the shoes\" of VMware in terms of the rights You grant and how the terms and conditions apply to You and the licensees of Your Modifications.

It applies to a given file (the \"Runtime Library\") that bears a notice placed by the copyright holder of the file stating that the file is governed by GPLv3 along with this Exception. \r\n\r\nWhen you use GCC to compile a program, GCC may combine portions of certain GCC header files and runtime libraries with the compiled program. The purpose of this Exception is to allow compilation of non-GPL (including proprietary) programs to use, in this way, the header files and runtime libraries covered by this Exception. \r\n\r\n0. Definitions. \r\nA file is an \"Independent Module\" if it either requires the Runtime Library for execution after a Compilation Process, or makes use of an interface provided by the Runtime Library, but is not otherwise based on the Runtime Library. \r\n\"GCC\" means a version of the GNU Compiler Collection, with or without modifications, governed by version 3 (or a specified later version) of the GNU General Public License (GPL) with the option of using any subsequent versions published by the FSF. \r\n\"GPL-compatible Software\" is software whose conditions of propagation, modification and use would permit combination with GCC in accord with the license of GCC. \r\n\r\n\"Target Code\" refers to output from any compiler for a real or virtual target processor architecture, in executable form or suitable for input to an assembler, loader, linker and\/or execution phase. Notwithstanding that, Target Code does not include data in any format that is used as a compiler intermediate representation, or used for producing a compiler intermediate representation. \r\nThe \"Compilation Process\" transforms code entirely represented in non-intermediate languages designed for human-written code, and\/or in Java Virtual Machine byte code, into Target Code. Thus, for example, use of source code generators and preprocessors need not be considered part of the Compilation Process, since the Compilation Process can be understood as starting with the output of the generators or preprocessors. \r\n\r\nA Compilation Process is \"Eligible\" if it is done using GCC, alone or with other GPL-compatible software, or if it is done without using any work based on GCC. For example, using non-GPL-compatible Software to optimize any GCC intermediate representations would not qualify as an Eligible Compilation Process. \r\n\r\n1. Grant of Additional Permission. \r\nYou have permission to propagate a work of Target Code formed by combining the Runtime Library with Independent Modules, even if such propagation would otherwise violate the terms of GPLv3, provided that all Target Code was generated by Eligible Compilation Processes. You may then convey such a combination under terms of your choice, consistent with the licensing of the Independent Modules. \r\n\r\n2. No Weakening of GCC Copyleft. \r\nThe availability of this Exception does not imply any general presumption that third-party software is unaffected by the copyleft requirements of the license of GCC.",

Your Rights \r\n\r\nSubject to these terms and conditions of this License, the OCLC Office of Research (the \"Original Contributor\") and each subsequent contributor (collectively with the Original Contributor, the \"Contributors\") hereby grant you a non-exclusive, worldwide, no-charge, transferable license to execute, prepare derivative works of, and distribute (internally and externally), for commercial and noncommercial purposes, the original code contributed by Original Contributor and all Modifications (collectively called the \"Program\"). \r\n\r\nSection 2. Definitions \r\n\r\nA \"Modification\" to the Program is any addition to or deletion from the contents of any file of the Program and any new file that contains any part of the Program. If you make a Modification and distribute the Program externally you are a \"Contributor.\" The distribution of the Program must be under the terms of this license including those in Section 3 below. \r\n\r\nA \"Combined Work\" results from combining and integrating all or parts of the Program with other code. A Combined Work may be thought of as having multiple parents or being result of multiple lines of code development. \r\n\r\nSection 3. Distribution Licensing Terms \r\n\r\nA. General Requirements \r\nExcept as necessary to recognize third-party rights or third-party restriction (see below), a distribution of the Program in any of the forms listed below must not put any further restrictions on the recipient\u2019s exercise of the rights granted herein. \r\n\r\nAs a Contributor, you represent that your Modification(s) are your original creation(s) and, to the best of your knowledge, no third party has any claim (including but not limited to intellectual property claims) relating to your Modification(s). You represent that each of your Modifications includes complete details of any third-party right or other third-party restriction associated with any part of your Modification (including a copy of any applicable license agreement). \r\n\r\nThe Program must be distributed without charge beyond the costs of physically transferring the files to the recipient. \r\n\r\nThis Warranty Disclaimer\/Limitation of Liability must be prominently displayed with every distribution of the Program in any form: \r\n\r\nYOU AGREE THAT THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED AS-IS, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND (EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED). ACCORDINGLY, OCLC MAKES NO WARRANTIES, REPRESENTATIONS OR GUARANTEES, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, AND DISCLAIMS ALL SUCH WARRANTIES, REPRESENTATIONS OR GUARANTEES, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR ANY PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AS TO: (A) THE FUNCTIONALITY OR NONINFRINGEMENT OF PROGRAM, ANY MODIFICATION, A COMBINED WORK OR AN AGGREGATE WORK; OR (B) THE RESULTS OF ANY PROJECT UNDERTAKEN USING THE PROGRAM, ANY MODIFICATION, A COMBINED WORK OR AN AGGREGATE WORK. IN NO EVENT SHALL THE CONTRIBUTORS BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, CONSEQUENTIAL OR ANY OTHER DAMAGES (INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, PROCUREMENT OF SUBSTITUTE GOODS OR SERVICES; LOSS OF USE, DATA, OR PROFITS; OR BUSINESS INTERRUPTION) HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OF THE PROGRAM, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. YOU HEREBY WAIVE ANY CLAIMS FOR DAMAGES OF ANY KIND AGAINST CONTRIBUTORS WHICH MAY RESULT FROM YOUR USE OF THE PROGRAM. \r\n\r\nB. Requirements for a Distribution of Modifiable Code \r\nIf you distribute the Program in a form to which the recipient can make Modifications (e.g. source code), the terms of this license apply to use by recipient. In addition, each source and data file of the Program and any Modification you distribute must contain the following notice: \r\n\r\n\"Copyright (c) 2000- (insert then current year) OCLC Online Computer Library Center, Inc. and other contributors. All rights reserved. The contents of this file, as updated from time to time by the OCLC Office of Research, are subject to OCLC Research Public License Version 2.0 (the \"License\"); you may not use this file except in compliance with the License. You may obtain a current copy of the License at http:\/\/purl.oclc.org\/oclc\/research\/ORPL\/. Software distributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" basis, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, either express or implied. See the License for the specific language governing rights and limitations under the License. This software consists of voluntary contributions made by many individuals on behalf of OCLC Research. For more information on OCLC Research, please see http:\/\/www.oclc.org\/research\/. The Original Code is ______________________________. The Initial Developer of the Original Code is ________________________. Portions created by ______________________ are Copyright (C) _____ _______________________. All Rights Reserved. Contributor(s): ______________________________________.\" \r\n\r\nC. Requirements for a Distribution of Non-modifiable Code \r\nIf you distribute the Program in a form to which the recipient cannot make Modifications (e.g. object code), the terms of this license apply to use by recipient and you must include the following statement in appropriate and conspicuous locations: \r\n\r\n\"Copyright (c) 2000- (insert then current year) OCLC Online Computer Library Center, Inc. and other contributors. All rights reserved.\" \r\n\r\nIn addition, the source code must be included with the object code distribution or the distributor must provide the source code to the recipient upon request. \r\n\r\nD. Requirements for a Combined Work Distribution \r\nDistributions of Combined Works are subject to the terms of this license and must be made at no charge to the recipient beyond the costs of physically transferring the files to recipient. \r\n\r\nA Combined Work may be distributed as either modifiable or non-modifiable code. The requirements of Section 3.B or 3.C above (as appropriate) apply to such distributions. \r\n\r\nAn \"Aggregate Work\" is when the Program exists, without integration, with other programs on a storage medium. This License does not apply to portions of an Aggregate Work which are not covered by the definition of \"Program\" provided in this License. You are not forbidden from selling an Aggregate Work. However, the Program contained in an Aggregate Work is subject to this License. Also, should the Program be extracted from an Aggregate Work, this License applies to any use of the Program apart from the Aggregate Work. \r\n\r\nSection 4. License Grant \r\n\r\nFor purposes of permitting use of your Modifications by OCLC and other licensees hereunder, you hereby grant to OCLC and such other licensees the non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free, transferable, sublicenseable license to execute, copy, alter, delete, modify, adapt, change, revise, enhance, develop, publicly display, distribute (internally and externally) and\/or create derivative works based on your Modifications (and derivative works thereof) in accordance with these Terms. This Section 4 shall survive termination of this License for any reason. \r\n\r\nSection 5. Termination of Rights \r\n\r\nThis non-exclusive license (with respect to the grant from a particular Contributor) automatically terminates for any entity that initiates legal action for intellectual property infringement (with respect to the Program) against such Contributor as of the initiation of such action. \r\n\r\nIf you fail to comply with this License, your rights (but not your obligations) under this License shall terminate automatically unless you cure such breach within thirty (30) days of becoming aware of the noncompliance. All sublicenses granted by you which preexist such termination and are properly granted shall survive such termination. \r\n\r\nSection 6. Other Terms \r\n\r\nExcept for the copyright notices required above, you may not use any trademark of any of the Contributors without the prior written consent of the relevant Contributor. You agree not to remove, alter or obscure any copyright or other proprietary rights notice contained in the Program. \r\n\r\nAll transfers of the Program or any part thereof shall be made in compliance with U.S. import\/export regulations or other restrictions of the U.S. Department of Commerce, as well as other similar trade or commerce restrictions which might apply. \r\n\r\nAny patent obtained by any party covering the Program or any part thereof must include a provision providing for the free, perpetual and unrestricted commercial and noncommercial use by any third party. \r\n\r\nIf, as a consequence of a court judgment or settlement relating to intellectual property infringement or any other cause of action, conditions are imposed on you that contradict the conditions of this License, such conditions do not excuse you from compliance with this License. If you cannot distribute the Program so as to simultaneously satisfy your obligations under this License and such other conditions, you may not distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, you could not satisfy both the patent license and this License, and you would be required to refrain entirely from distribution of the Program. \r\n\r\nIf you learn of a third party claim or other restriction relating to a Program you have already distributed you shall promptly redo your Program to address the issue and take all reasonable steps to inform those who may have received the Program at issue. An example of an appropriate reasonable step to inform would be posting an announcement on an appropriate web bulletin board. \r\n\r\nThe provisions of this License are deemed to be severable, and the invalidity or unenforceability of any provision shall not affect or impair the remaining provisions which shall continue in full force and effect. In substitution for any provision held unlawful, there shall be substituted a provision of similar import reflecting the original intent of the parties hereto to the extent permissible under law. \r\n\r\nThe Original Contributor from time to time may change this License, and the amended license will apply to all copies of the Program downloaded after the new license is posted. This License grants only the rights expressly stated herein and provides you with no implied rights or licenses to the intellectual property of any Contributor. \r\n\r\nThis License is the complete and exclusive statement of the agreement between the parties concerning the subject matter hereof and may not be amended except by the written agreement of the parties. This License shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Ohio and the United States of America, without regard to principles of conflicts of law.",

However, if by modifying Autoconf you cause any Ineligible Code of the version you received to become Normally Copied Code of your modified version, then you void this Exception for the resulting covered work. If you convey that resulting covered work, you must remove this Exception in accordance with the second paragraph of Section 7 of GPLv3. \r\n\r\n2.

API conformance is \r\nhighly measurable and suppliers who claim it must be able to \r\nsubstantiate that claim. \r\n\r\nAs such, since these are benchmark measures of conformance, we feel \r\nthe integrity of test tools is of importance. In order to preserve \r\nthe integrity of the existing conformance modes of this test \r\npackage and to permit recipients of modified versions of this \r\npackage to run the original test modes, this license requires that \r\nthe original test modes be preserved. \r\n\r\nIf you find a bug in one of the standards mode test cases, please \r\nlet us know so we can feed this back into the original, and also \r\nraise any specification issues with the appropriate bodies (for \r\nexample the POSIX committees). \r\n\r\nDefinitions: \r\n\r\n\"Package\" refers to the collection of files distributed by the \r\nCopyright Holder, and derivatives of that collection of files \r\ncreated through textual modification. \r\n\"Standard Version\" refers to such a Package if it has not been \r\nmodified, or has been modified in accordance with the wishes \r\nof the Copyright Holder. \r\n\"Copyright Holder\" is whoever is named in the copyright or \r\ncopyrights for the package. \"You\" is you, if you're thinking \r\nabout copying or distributing this Package. \r\n\"Reasonable copying fee\" is whatever you can justify on the \r\nbasis of media cost, duplication charges, time of people \r\ninvolved, and so on. (You will not be required to justify it \r\nto the Copyright Holder, but only to the computing community \r\nat large as a market that must bear the fee.) \r\n\"Freely Available\" means that no fee is charged for the item \r\nitself, though there may be fees involved in handling the \r\nitem. It also means that recipients of the item may \r\nredistribute it under the same conditions they received it. \r\n\r\n1. You may make and give away verbatim copies of the source form of \r\nthe Standard Version of this Package without restriction, provided \r\nthat you duplicate all of the original copyright notices and \r\nassociated disclaimers. \r\n\r\n2. You may apply bug fixes, portability fixes and other \r\nmodifications derived from the Public Domain or from the Copyright \r\nHolder. A Package modified in such a way shall still be considered \r\nthe Standard Version. \r\n\r\n3. You may otherwise modify your copy of this Package in any way, \r\nprovided that you insert a prominent notice in each changed file \r\nstating how and when you changed that file, and provided that you \r\ndo at least the following: \r\n\r\nrename any non-standard executables and testcases so the \r\nnames do not conflict with standard executables and \r\ntestcases, which must also be provided, and provide a \r\nseparate manual page for each non-standard executable and \r\ntestcase that clearly documents how it differs from the \r\nStandard Version. \r\n\r\n4. You may distribute the programs of this Package in object code \r\nor executable form, provided that you do at least the following: \r\n\r\naccompany any non-standard executables and testcases with \r\ntheir corresponding Standard Version executables and \r\ntestcases, giving the non-standard executables and \r\ntestcases non-standard names, and clearly documenting the \r\ndifferences in manual pages (or equivalent), together with \r\ninstructions on where to get the Standard Version. \r\n\r\n5. You may charge a reasonable copying fee for any distribution of \r\nthis Package. You may charge any fee you choose for support of this \r\nPackage. You may not charge a fee for this Package itself. However, \r\nyou may distribute this Package in aggregate with other (possibly \r\ncommercial) programs as part of a larger (possibly commercial) \r\nsoftware distribution provided that you do not advertise this \r\nPackage as a product of your own. \r\n\r\n6. The scripts and library files supplied as input to or produced \r\nas output from the programs of this Package do not automatically \r\nfall under the copyright of this Package, but belong to whomever \r\ngenerated them, and may be sold commercially, and may be aggregated \r\nwith this Package. \r\n\r\n7.Subroutines supplied by you and linked into this Package shall \r\nnot be considered part of this Package. \r\n\r\n8.

If You created one or more Modification(s) You may add your \r\nname as a Contributor to the notice described in Exhibit A. You must also \r\nduplicate this License in any documentation for the Source Code where You \r\ndescribe recipients' rights or ownership rights relating to Covered Software. \r\nYou may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity \r\nor liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Software. \r\nHowever, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of Nokia \r\nor any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any such warranty, \r\nsupport, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and \r\nYou hereby agree to indemnify Nokia and every Contributor for any liability \r\nincurred by Nokia or such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, \r\nindemnity or liability terms You offer. \r\n\r\n3.6 Distribution of Executable Versions. \r\n\r\nYou may distribute Covered Software in Executable form only if the \r\nrequirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered Software, \r\nand if You include a notice stating that the Source Code version of the \r\nCovered Software is available under the terms of this License, including \r\na description of how and where You have fulfilled the obligations of Section \r\n3.2.

You may distribute the Executable \r\nversion of Covered Software or ownership rights under a license of Your \r\nchoice, which may contain terms different from this License, provided that \r\nYou are in compliance with the terms of this License and that the license \r\nfor the Executable version does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient's \r\nrights in the Source Code version from the rights set forth in this License. \r\nIf You distribute the Executable version under a different license You \r\nmust make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ from this License \r\nare offered by You alone, not by Nokia or any Contributor. You hereby agree \r\nto indemnify Nokia and every Contributor for any liability incurred by \r\nNokia or such Contributor as a result of any such terms You offer. \r\n\r\n3.7 Larger Works. \r\n\r\nYou may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Software with other \r\nsoftware not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger \r\nWork as a single product.

Licensor grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, sublicensable license, for the duration of the copyright, to do the following: \r\n\r\na) to reproduce the Original Work in copies, either alone or as part of a collective work; \r\n\r\nb) to translate, adapt, alter, transform, modify, or arrange the Original Work, thereby creating derivative works (\"Derivative Works\") based upon the Original Work; \r\n\r\nc) to distribute or communicate copies of the Original Work and Derivative Works to the public, with the proviso that copies of Original Work or Derivative Works that You distribute or communicate shall be licensed under this Non-Profit Open Software License or as provided in section 17(d); \r\n\r\nd) to perform the Original Work publicly; and \r\n\r\ne) to display the Original Work publicly. \r\n\r\n2) Grant of Patent License. Licensor grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, sublicensable license, under patent claims owned or controlled by the Licensor that are embodied in the Original Work as furnished by the Licensor, for the duration of the patents, to make, use, sell, offer for sale, have made, and import the Original Work and Derivative Works. \r\n\r\n3) Grant of Source Code License. The term \"Source Code\" means the preferred form of the Original Work for making modifications to it and all available documentation describing how to modify the Original Work. Licensor agrees to provide a machine-readable copy of the Source Code of the Original Work along with each copy of the Original Work that Licensor distributes. Licensor reserves the right to satisfy this obligation by placing a machine-readable copy of the Source Code in an information repository reasonably calculated to permit inexpensive and convenient access by You for as long as Licensor continues to distribute the Original Work. \r\n\r\n4) Exclusions From License Grant. Neither the names of Licensor, nor the names of any contributors to the Original Work, nor any of their trademarks or service marks, may be used to endorse or promote products derived from this Original Work without express prior permission of the Licensor. Except as expressly stated herein, nothing in this License grants any license to Licensor's trademarks, copyrights, patents, trade secrets or any other intellectual property. No patent license is granted to make, use, sell, offer for sale, have made, or import embodiments of any patent claims other than the licensed claims defined in Section 2. No license is granted to the trademarks of Licensor even if such marks are included in the Original Work. Nothing in this License shall be interpreted to prohibit Licensor from licensing under terms different from this License any Original Work that Licensor otherwise would have a right to license. \r\n\r\n5) External Deployment. The term \"External Deployment\" means the use, distribution, or communication of the Original Work or Derivative Works in any way such that the Original Work or Derivative Works may be used by anyone other than You, whether those works are distributed or communicated to those persons or made available as an application intended for use over a network. As an express condition for the grants of license hereunder, You must treat any External Deployment by You of the Original Work or a Derivative Work as a distribution under section 1(c). \r\n\r\n6) Attribution Rights. You must retain, in the Source Code of any Derivative Works that You create, all copyright, patent, or trademark notices from the Source Code of the Original Work, as well as any notices of licensing and any descriptive text identified therein as an \"Attribution Notice.\" You must cause the Source Code for any Derivative Works that You create to carry a prominent Attribution Notice reasonably calculated to inform recipients that You have modified the Original Work. \r\n\r\n7) Warranty of Provenance and Disclaimer of Warranty. The Original Work is provided under this License on an \"AS IS\" BASIS and WITHOUT WARRANTY, either express or implied, including, without limitation, the warranties of non-infringement, merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY OF THE ORIGINAL WORK IS WITH YOU. This DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY constitutes an essential part of this License. No license to the Original Work is granted by this License except under this disclaimer. \r\n\r\n8) Limitation of Liability. Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall the Licensor be liable to anyone for any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this License or the use of the Original Work including, without limitation, damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses. This limitation of liability shall not apply to the extent applicable law prohibits such limitation. \r\n\r\n9) Acceptance and Termination. If, at any time, You expressly assented to this License, that assent indicates your clear and irrevocable acceptance of this License and all of its terms and conditions. If You distribute or communicate copies of the Original Work or a Derivative Work, You must make a reasonable effort under the circumstances to obtain the express assent of recipients to the terms of this License. This License conditions your rights to undertake the activities listed in Section 1, including your right to create Derivative Works based upon the Original Work, and doing so without honoring these terms and conditions is prohibited by copyright law and international treaty. Nothing in this License is intended to affect copyright exceptions and limitations (including \"fair use\" or \"fair dealing\"). This License shall terminate immediately and You may no longer exercise any of the rights granted to You by this License upon your failure to honor the conditions in Section 1(c). \r\n\r\n10) Termination for Patent Action. This License shall terminate automatically and You may no longer exercise any of the rights granted to You by this License as of the date You commence an action, including a cross-claim or counterclaim, against Licensor or any licensee alleging that the Original Work infringes a patent. This termination provision shall not apply for an action alleging patent infringement by combinations of the Original Work with other software or hardware. \r\n\r\n11) Jurisdiction, Venue and Governing Law. Any action or suit relating to this License may be brought only in the courts of a jurisdiction wherein the Licensor resides or in which Licensor conducts its primary business, and under the laws of that jurisdiction excluding its conflict-of-law provisions. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any use of the Original Work outside the scope of this License or after its termination shall be subject to the requirements and penalties of copyright or patent law in the appropriate jurisdiction. This section shall survive the termination of this License. \r\n\r\n12) Attorneys' Fees. In any action to enforce the terms of this License or seeking damages relating thereto, the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover its costs and expenses, including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees and costs incurred in connection with such action, including any appeal of such action. This section shall survive the termination of this License. \r\n\r\n13) Miscellaneous. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable. \r\n\r\n14) Definition of \"You\" in This License. \"You\" throughout this License, whether in upper or lower case, means an individual or a legal entity exercising rights under, and complying with all of the terms of, this License. For legal entities, \"You\" includes any entity that controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with you. For purposes of this definition, \"control\" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity. \r\n\r\n15) Right to Use. You may use the Original Work in all ways not otherwise restricted or conditioned by this License or by law, and Licensor promises not to interfere with or be responsible for such uses by You. \r\n\r\n16) Modification of This License. This License is Copyright \u00a9 2005 Lawrence Rosen. Permission is granted to copy, distribute, or communicate this License without modification. Nothing in this License permits You to modify this License as applied to the Original Work or to Derivative Works. However, You may modify the text of this License and copy, distribute or communicate your modified version (the \"Modified License\") and apply it to other original works of authorship subject to the following conditions: (i) You may not indicate in any way that your Modified License is the \"Open Software License\" or \"OSL\" and you may not use those names in the name of your Modified License; (ii) You must replace the notice specified in the first paragraph above with the notice \"Licensed under <insert your license name here>\" or with a notice of your own that is not confusingly similar to the notice in this License; and (iii) You may not claim that your original works are open source software unless your Modified License has been approved by Open Source Initiative (OSI) and You comply with its license review and certification process. \r\n\r\n17) Non-Profit Amendment. The name of this amended version of the Open Software License (\"OSL 3.0\") is \"Non-Profit Open Software License 3.0\". The original OSL 3.0 license has been amended as follows: \r\n\r\n(a) Licensor represents and declares that it is a not-for-profit organization that derives no revenue whatsoever from the distribution of the Original Work or Derivative Works thereof, or from support or services relating thereto. \r\n\r\n(b) The first sentence of Section 7 [\"Warranty of Provenance\"] of OSL 3.0 has been stricken. For Original Works licensed under this Non-Profit OSL 3.0, LICENSOR OFFERS NO WARRANTIES WHATSOEVER. \r\n\r\n(c) In the first sentence of Section 8 [\"Limitation of Liability\"] of this Non-Profit OSL 3.0, the list of damages for which LIABILITY IS LIMITED now includes \"direct\" damages. \r\n\r\n(d) The proviso in Section 1(c) of this License now refers to this \"Non-Profit Open Software License\" rather than the \"Open Software License\". You may distribute or communicate the Original Work or Derivative Works thereof under this Non-Profit OSL 3.0 license only if You make the representation and declaration in paragraph (a) of this Section 17. Otherwise, You shall distribute or communicate the Original Work or Derivative Works thereof only under the OSL 3.0 license and You shall publish clear licensing notices so stating. Also by way of clarification, this License does not authorize You to distribute or communicate works under this Non-Profit OSL 3.0 if You received them under the original OSL 3.0 license. \r\n\r\n(e) Original Works licensed under this license shall reference \"Non-Profit OSL 3.0\" in licensing notices to distinguish them from works licensed under the original OSL 3.0 license.",

        "rf_text": "## ODC Open Database License (ODbL) \r\n\r\n### Preamble \r\n\r\nThe Open Database License (ODbL) is a license agreement intended to \r\nallow users to freely share, modify, and use this Database while \r\nmaintaining this same freedom for others. Many databases are covered by \r\ncopyright, and therefore this document licenses these rights. Some \r\njurisdictions, mainly in the European Union, have specific rights that \r\ncover databases, and so the ODbL addresses these rights, too. Finally, \r\nthe ODbL is also an agreement in contract for users of this Database to \r\nact in certain ways in return for accessing this Database. \r\n\r\nDatabases can contain a wide variety of types of content (images, \r\naudiovisual material, and sounds all in the same database, for example), \r\nand so the ODbL only governs the rights over the Database, and not the \r\ncontents of the Database individually. Licensors should use the ODbL \r\ntogether with another license for the contents, if the contents have a \r\nsingle set of rights that uniformly covers all of the contents. If the \r\ncontents have multiple sets of different rights, Licensors should \r\ndescribe what rights govern what contents together in the individual \r\nrecord or in some other way that clarifies what rights apply. \r\n\r\nSometimes the contents of a database, or the database itself, can be \r\ncovered by other rights not addressed here (such as private contracts, \r\ntrade mark over the name, or privacy rights \/ data protection rights \r\nover information in the contents), and so you are advised that you may \r\nhave to consult other documents or clear other rights before doing \r\nactivities not covered by this License. \r\n\r\n------ \r\n\r\nThe Licensor (as defined below) \r\n\r\nand \r\n\r\nYou (as defined below) \r\n\r\nagree as follows: \r\n\r\n### 1.0 Definitions of Capitalised Words \r\n\r\n\"Collective Database\" \u2013 Means this Database in unmodified form as part \r\nof a collection of independent databases in themselves that together are \r\nassembled into a collective whole. A work that constitutes a Collective \r\nDatabase will not be considered a Derivative Database. \r\n\r\n\"Convey\" \u2013 As a verb, means Using the Database, a Derivative Database, \r\nor the Database as part of a Collective Database in any way that enables \r\na Person to make or receive copies of the Database or a Derivative \r\nDatabase. Conveying does not include interaction with a user through a \r\ncomputer network, or creating and Using a Produced Work, where no \r\ntransfer of a copy of the Database or a Derivative Database occurs. \r\n\"Contents\" \u2013 The contents of this Database, which includes the \r\ninformation, independent works, or other material collected into the \r\nDatabase. For example, the contents of the Database could be factual \r\ndata or works such as images, audiovisual material, text, or sounds. \r\n\r\n\"Database\" \u2013 A collection of material (the Contents) arranged in a \r\nsystematic or methodical way and individually accessible by electronic \r\nor other means offered under the terms of this License. \r\n\r\n\"Database Directive\" \u2013 Means Directive 96\/9\/EC of the European \r\nParliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection \r\nof databases, as amended or succeeded. \r\n\r\n\"Database Right\" \u2013 Means rights resulting from the Chapter III (\"sui \r\ngeneris\") rights in the Database Directive (as amended and as transposed \r\nby member states), which includes the Extraction and Re-utilisation of \r\nthe whole or a Substantial part of the Contents, as well as any similar \r\nrights available in the relevant jurisdiction under Section 10.4. \r\n\r\n\"Derivative Database\" \u2013 Means a database based upon the Database, and \r\nincludes any translation, adaptation, arrangement, modification, or any \r\nother alteration of the Database or of a Substantial part of the \r\nContents. This includes, but is not limited to, Extracting or \r\nRe-utilising the whole or a Substantial part of the Contents in a new \r\nDatabase. \r\n\r\n\"Extraction\" \u2013 Means the permanent or temporary transfer of all or a \r\nSubstantial part of the Contents to another medium by any means or in \r\nany form. \r\n\r\n\"License\" \u2013 Means this license agreement and is both a license of rights \r\nsuch as copyright and Database Rights and an agreement in contract. \r\n\r\n\"Licensor\" \u2013 Means the Person that offers the Database under the terms \r\nof this License. \r\n\r\n\"Person\" \u2013 Means a natural or legal person or a body of persons \r\ncorporate or incorporate. \r\n\r\n\"Produced Work\" \u2013 a work (such as an image, audiovisual material, text, \r\nor sounds) resulting from using the whole or a Substantial part of the \r\nContents (via a search or other query) from this Database, a Derivative \r\nDatabase, or this Database as part of a Collective Database. \r\n\r\n\"Publicly\" \u2013 means to Persons other than You or under Your control by \r\neither more than 50% ownership or by the power to direct their \r\nactivities (such as contracting with an independent consultant). \r\n\r\n\"Re-utilisation\" \u2013 means any form of making available to the public all \r\nor a Substantial part of the Contents by the distribution of copies, by \r\nrenting, by online or other forms of transmission. \r\n\r\n\"Substantial\" \u2013 Means substantial in terms of quantity or quality or a \r\ncombination of both. The repeated and systematic Extraction or \r\nRe-utilisation of insubstantial parts of the Contents may amount to the \r\nExtraction or Re-utilisation of a Substantial part of the Contents. \r\n\r\n\"Use\" \u2013 As a verb, means doing any act that is restricted by copyright \r\nor Database Rights whether in the original medium or any other; and \r\nincludes without limitation distributing, copying, publicly performing, \r\npublicly displaying, and preparing derivative works of the Database, as \r\nwell as modifying the Database as may be technically necessary to use it \r\nin a different mode or format. \r\n\r\n\"You\" \u2013 Means a Person exercising rights under this License who has not \r\npreviously violated the terms of this License with respect to the \r\nDatabase, or who has received express permission from the Licensor to \r\nexercise rights under this License despite a previous violation. \r\n\r\nWords in the singular include the plural and vice versa. \r\n\r\n### 2.0 What this License covers \r\n\r\n2.1. Legal effect of this document. This License is: \r\n\r\na. A license of applicable copyright and neighbouring rights; \r\n\r\nb. A license of the Database Right; and \r\n\r\nc. An agreement in contract between You and the Licensor. \r\n\r\n2.2 Legal rights covered. This License covers the legal rights in the \r\nDatabase, including: \r\n\r\na. Copyright. Any copyright or neighbouring rights in the Database. \r\nThe copyright licensed includes any individual elements of the \r\nDatabase, but does not cover the copyright over the Contents \r\nindependent of this Database. See Section 2.4 for details. Copyright \r\nlaw varies between jurisdictions, but is likely to cover: the Database \r\nmodel or schema, which is the structure, arrangement, and organisation \r\nof the Database, and can also include the Database tables and table \r\nindexes; the data entry and output sheets; and the Field names of \r\nContents stored in the Database; \r\n\r\nb. Database Rights. Database Rights only extend to the Extraction and \r\nRe-utilisation of the whole or a Substantial part of the Contents. \r\nDatabase Rights can apply even when there is no copyright over the \r\nDatabase. Database Rights can also apply when the Contents are removed \r\nfrom the Database and are selected and arranged in a way that would \r\nnot infringe any applicable copyright; and \r\n\r\nc. Contract. This is an agreement between You and the Licensor for \r\naccess to the Database. In return you agree to certain conditions of \r\nuse on this access as outlined in this License. \r\n\r\n2.3 Rights not covered. \r\n\r\na. This License does not apply to computer programs used in the making \r\nor operation of the Database; \r\n\r\nb. This License does not cover any patents over the Contents or the \r\nDatabase; and \r\n\r\nc. This License does not cover any trademarks associated with the \r\nDatabase. \r\n\r\n2.4 Relationship to Contents in the Database. The individual items of \r\nthe Contents contained in this Database may be covered by other rights, \r\nincluding copyright, patent, data protection, privacy, or personality \r\nrights, and this License does not cover any rights (other than Database \r\nRights or in contract) in individual Contents contained in the Database. \r\nFor example, if used on a Database of images (the Contents), this \r\nLicense would not apply to copyright over individual images, which could \r\nhave their own separate licenses, or one single license covering all of \r\nthe rights over the images. \r\n\r\n### 3.0 Rights granted \r\n\r\n3.1 Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, the Licensor \r\ngrants to You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, terminable (but \r\nonly under Section 9) license to Use the Database for the duration of \r\nany applicable copyright and Database Rights. These rights explicitly \r\ninclude commercial use, and do not exclude any field of endeavour. To \r\nthe extent possible in the relevant jurisdiction, these rights may be \r\nexercised in all media and formats whether now known or created in the \r\nfuture. \r\n\r\nThe rights granted cover, for example: \r\n\r\na. Extraction and Re-utilisation of the whole or a Substantial part of \r\nthe Contents; \r\n\r\nb. Creation of Derivative Databases; \r\n\r\nc. Creation of Collective Databases; \r\n\r\nd. Creation of temporary or permanent reproductions by any means and \r\nin any form, in whole or in part, including of any Derivative \r\nDatabases or as a part of Collective Databases; and \r\n\r\ne. Distribution, communication, display, lending, making available, or \r\nperformance to the public by any means and in any form, in whole or in \r\npart, including of any Derivative Database or as a part of Collective \r\nDatabases. \r\n\r\n3.2 Compulsory license schemes. For the avoidance of doubt: \r\n\r\na. Non-waivable compulsory license schemes. In those jurisdictions in \r\nwhich the right to collect royalties through any statutory or \r\ncompulsory licensing scheme cannot be waived, the Licensor reserves \r\nthe exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You \r\nof the rights granted under this License; \r\n\r\nb. Waivable compulsory license schemes. In those jurisdictions in \r\nwhich the right to collect royalties through any statutory or \r\ncompulsory licensing scheme can be waived, the Licensor waives the \r\nexclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You of \r\nthe rights granted under this License; and, \r\n\r\nc. Voluntary license schemes. The Licensor waives the right to collect \r\nroyalties, whether individually or, in the event that the Licensor is \r\na member of a collecting society that administers voluntary licensing \r\nschemes, via that society, from any exercise by You of the rights \r\ngranted under this License. \r\n\r\n3.3 The right to release the Database under different terms, or to stop \r\ndistributing or making available the Database, is reserved. Note that \r\nthis Database may be multiple-licensed, and so You may have the choice \r\nof using alternative licenses for this Database. Subject to Section \r\n10.4, all other rights not expressly granted by Licensor are reserved. \r\n\r\n### 4.0 Conditions of Use \r\n\r\n4.1 The rights granted in Section 3 above are expressly made subject to \r\nYour complying with the following conditions of use. These are important \r\nconditions of this License, and if You fail to follow them, You will be \r\nin material breach of its terms. \r\n\r\n4.2 Notices. If You Publicly Convey this Database, any Derivative \r\nDatabase, or the Database as part of a Collective Database, then You \r\nmust: \r\n\r\na. Do so only under the terms of this License or another license \r\npermitted under Section 4.4; \r\n\r\nb. Include a copy of this License (or, as applicable, a license \r\npermitted under Section 4.4) or its Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) \r\nwith the Database or Derivative Database, including both in the \r\nDatabase or Derivative Database and in any relevant documentation; and \r\n\r\nc. Keep intact any copyright or Database Right notices and notices \r\nthat refer to this License. \r\n\r\nd. If it is not possible to put the required notices in a particular \r\nfile due to its structure, then You must include the notices in a \r\nlocation (such as a relevant directory) where users would be likely to \r\nlook for it. \r\n\r\n4.3 Notice for using output (Contents). Creating and Using a Produced \r\nWork does not require the notice in Section 4.2. However, if you \r\nPublicly Use a Produced Work, You must include a notice associated with \r\nthe Produced Work reasonably calculated to make any Person that uses, \r\nviews, accesses, interacts with, or is otherwise exposed to the Produced \r\nWork aware that Content was obtained from the Database, Derivative \r\nDatabase, or the Database as part of a Collective Database, and that it \r\nis available under this License. \r\n\r\na. Example notice. The following text will satisfy notice under \r\nSection 4.3: \r\n\r\nContains information from DATABASE NAME, which is made available \r\nhere under the Open Database License (ODbL). \r\n\r\nDATABASE NAME should be replaced with the name of the Database and a \r\nhyperlink to the URI of the Database. \"Open Database License\" should \r\ncontain a hyperlink to the URI of the text of this License. If \r\nhyperlinks are not possible, You should include the plain text of the \r\nrequired URI's with the above notice. \r\n\r\n4.4 Share alike. \r\n\r\na. Any Derivative Database that You Publicly Use must be only under \r\nthe terms of: \r\n\r\ni. This License; \r\n\r\nii. A later version of this License similar in spirit to this \r\nLicense; or \r\n\r\niii. A compatible license. \r\n\r\nIf You license the Derivative Database under one of the licenses \r\nmentioned in (iii), You must comply with the terms of that license. \r\n\r\nb. For the avoidance of doubt, Extraction or Re-utilisation of the \r\nwhole or a Substantial part of the Contents into a new database is a \r\nDerivative Database and must comply with Section 4.4. \r\n\r\nc. Derivative Databases and Produced Works. A Derivative Database is \r\nPublicly Used and so must comply with Section 4.4. if a Produced Work \r\ncreated from the Derivative Database is Publicly Used. \r\n\r\nd. Share Alike and additional Contents. For the avoidance of doubt, \r\nYou must not add Contents to Derivative Databases under Section 4.4 a \r\nthat are incompatible with the rights granted under this License. \r\n\r\ne. Compatible licenses. Licensors may authorise a proxy to determine \r\ncompatible licenses under Section 4.4 a iii. If they do so, the \r\nauthorised proxy's public statement of acceptance of a compatible \r\nlicense grants You permission to use the compatible license. \r\n\r\n\r\n4.5 Limits of Share Alike. The requirements of Section 4.4 do not apply \r\nin the following: \r\n\r\na. For the avoidance of doubt, You are not required to license \r\nCollective Databases under this License if You incorporate this \r\nDatabase or a Derivative Database in the collection, but this License \r\nstill applies to this Database or a Derivative Database as a part of \r\nthe Collective Database; \r\n\r\nb. Using this Database, a Derivative Database, or this Database as \r\npart of a Collective Database to create a Produced Work does not \r\ncreate a Derivative Database for purposes of Section 4.4; and \r\n\r\nc. Use of a Derivative Database internally within an organisation is \r\nnot to the public and therefore does not fall under the requirements \r\nof Section 4.4. \r\n\r\n4.6 Access to Derivative Databases. If You Publicly Use a Derivative \r\nDatabase or a Produced Work from a Derivative Database, You must also \r\noffer to recipients of the Derivative Database or Produced Work a copy \r\nin a machine readable form of: \r\n\r\na. The entire Derivative Database; or \r\n\r\nb. A file containing all of the alterations made to the Database or \r\nthe method of making the alterations to the Database (such as an \r\nalgorithm), including any additional Contents, that make up all the \r\ndifferences between the Database and the Derivative Database. \r\n\r\nThe Derivative Database (under a.) or alteration file (under b.) must be \r\navailable at no more than a reasonable production cost for physical \r\ndistributions and free of charge if distributed over the internet. \r\n\r\n4.7 Technological measures and additional terms \r\n\r\na. This License does not allow You to impose (except subject to \r\nSection 4.7 b.) any terms or any technological measures on the \r\nDatabase, a Derivative Database, or the whole or a Substantial part of \r\nthe Contents that alter or restrict the terms of this License, or any \r\nrights granted under it, or have the effect or intent of restricting \r\nthe ability of any person to exercise those rights. \r\n\r\nb. Parallel distribution. You may impose terms or technological \r\nmeasures on the Database, a Derivative Database, or the whole or a \r\nSubstantial part of the Contents (a \"Restricted Database\") in \r\ncontravention of Section 4.74 a. only if You also make a copy of the \r\nDatabase or a Derivative Database available to the recipient of the \r\nRestricted Database: \r\n\r\ni. That is available without additional fee; \r\n\r\nii. That is available in a medium that does not alter or restrict \r\nthe terms of this License, or any rights granted under it, or have \r\nthe effect or intent of restricting the ability of any person to \r\nexercise those rights (an \"Unrestricted Database\"); and \r\n\r\niii. The Unrestricted Database is at least as accessible to the \r\nrecipient as a practical matter as the Restricted Database. \r\n\r\nc. For the avoidance of doubt, You may place this Database or a \r\nDerivative Database in an authenticated environment, behind a \r\npassword, or within a similar access control scheme provided that You \r\ndo not alter or restrict the terms of this License or any rights \r\ngranted under it or have the effect or intent of restricting the \r\nability of any person to exercise those rights. \r\n\r\n4.8 Licensing of others. You may not sublicense the Database. Each time \r\nYou communicate the Database, the whole or Substantial part of the \r\nContents, or any Derivative Database to anyone else in any way, the \r\nLicensor offers to the recipient a license to the Database on the same \r\nterms and conditions as this License. You are not responsible for \r\nenforcing compliance by third parties with this License, but You may \r\nenforce any rights that You have over a Derivative Database. You are \r\nsolely responsible for any modifications of a Derivative Database made \r\nby You or another Person at Your direction. You may not impose any \r\nfurther restrictions on the exercise of the rights granted or affirmed \r\nunder this License. \r\n\r\n### 5.0 Moral rights \r\n\r\n5.1 Moral rights. This section covers moral rights, including any rights \r\nto be identified as the author of the Database or to object to treatment \r\nthat would otherwise prejudice the author's honour and reputation, or \r\nany other derogatory treatment: \r\n\r\na. For jurisdictions allowing waiver of moral rights, Licensor waives \r\nall moral rights that Licensor may have in the Database to the fullest \r\nextent possible by the law of the relevant jurisdiction under Section \r\n10.4; \r\n\r\nb. If waiver of moral rights under Section 5.1 a in the relevant \r\njurisdiction is not possible, Licensor agrees not to assert any moral \r\nrights over the Database and waives all claims in moral rights to the \r\nfullest extent possible by the law of the relevant jurisdiction under \r\nSection 10.4; and \r\n\r\nc. For jurisdictions not allowing waiver or an agreement not to assert \r\nmoral rights under Section 5.1 a and b, the author may retain their \r\nmoral rights over certain aspects of the Database. \r\n\r\nPlease note that some jurisdictions do not allow for the waiver of moral \r\nrights, and so moral rights may still subsist over the Database in some \r\njurisdictions. \r\n\r\n### 6.0 Fair dealing, Database exceptions, and other rights not affected \r\n\r\n6.1 This License does not affect any rights that You or anyone else may \r\nindependently have under any applicable law to make any use of this \r\nDatabase, including without limitation: \r\n\r\na. Exceptions to the Database Right including: Extraction of Contents \r\nfrom non-electronic Databases for private purposes, Extraction for \r\npurposes of illustration for teaching or scientific research, and \r\nExtraction or Re-utilisation for public security or an administrative \r\nor judicial procedure. \r\n\r\nb. Fair dealing, fair use, or any other legally recognised limitation \r\nor exception to infringement of copyright or other applicable laws. \r\n\r\n6.2 This License does not affect any rights of lawful users to Extract \r\nand Re-utilise insubstantial parts of the Contents, evaluated \r\nquantitatively or qualitatively, for any purposes whatsoever, including \r\ncreating a Derivative Database (subject to other rights over the \r\nContents, see Section 2.4). The repeated and systematic Extraction or \r\nRe-utilisation of insubstantial parts of the Contents may however amount \r\nto the Extraction or Re-utilisation of a Substantial part of the \r\nContents. \r\n\r\n### 7.0 Warranties and Disclaimer \r\n\r\n7.1 The Database is licensed by the Licensor \"as is\" and without any \r\nwarranty of any kind, either express, implied, or arising by statute, \r\ncustom, course of dealing, or trade usage. Licensor specifically \r\ndisclaims any and all implied warranties or conditions of title, \r\nnon-infringement, accuracy or completeness, the presence or absence of \r\nerrors, fitness for a particular purpose, merchantability, or otherwise. \r\nSome jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of implied warranties, so \r\nthis exclusion may not apply to You. \r\n\r\n### 8.0 Limitation of liability \r\n\r\n8.1 Subject to any liability that may not be excluded or limited by law, \r\nthe Licensor is not liable for, and expressly excludes, all liability \r\nfor loss or damage however and whenever caused to anyone by any use \r\nunder this License, whether by You or by anyone else, and whether caused \r\nby any fault on the part of the Licensor or not. This exclusion of \r\nliability includes, but is not limited to, any special, incidental, \r\nconsequential, punitive, or exemplary damages such as loss of revenue, \r\ndata, anticipated profits, and lost business. This exclusion applies \r\neven if the Licensor has been advised of the possibility of such \r\ndamages. \r\n\r\n8.2 If liability may not be excluded by law, it is limited to actual and \r\ndirect financial loss to the extent it is caused by proved negligence on \r\nthe part of the Licensor. \r\n\r\n### 9.0 Termination of Your rights under this License \r\n\r\n9.1 Any breach by You of the terms and conditions of this License \r\nautomatically terminates this License with immediate effect and without \r\nnotice to You. For the avoidance of doubt, Persons who have received the \r\nDatabase, the whole or a Substantial part of the Contents, Derivative \r\nDatabases, or the Database as part of a Collective Database from You \r\nunder this License will not have their licenses terminated provided \r\ntheir use is in full compliance with this License or a license granted \r\nunder Section 4.8 of this License. Sections 1, 2, 7, 8, 9 and 10 will \r\nsurvive any termination of this License. \r\n\r\n9.2 If You are not in breach of the terms of this License, the Licensor \r\nwill not terminate Your rights under it. \r\n\r\n9.3 Unless terminated under Section 9.1, this License is granted to You \r\nfor the duration of applicable rights in the Database. \r\n\r\n9.4 Reinstatement of rights. If you cease any breach of the terms and \r\nconditions of this License, then your full rights under this License \r\nwill be reinstated: \r\n\r\na. Provisionally and subject to permanent termination until the 60th \r\nday after cessation of breach; \r\n\r\nb. Permanently on the 60th day after cessation of breach unless \r\notherwise reasonably notified by the Licensor; or \r\n\r\nc. Permanently if reasonably notified by the Licensor of the \r\nviolation, this is the first time You have received notice of \r\nviolation of this License from the Licensor, and You cure the \r\nviolation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice. \r\n\r\nPersons subject to permanent termination of rights are not eligible to \r\nbe a recipient and receive a license under Section 4.8. \r\n\r\n9.5 Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release \r\nthe Database under different license terms or to stop distributing or \r\nmaking available the Database. Releasing the Database under different \r\nlicense terms or stopping the distribution of the Database will not \r\nwithdraw this License (or any other license that has been, or is \r\nrequired to be, granted under the terms of this License), and this \r\nLicense will continue in full force and effect unless terminated as \r\nstated above. \r\n\r\n### 10.0 General \r\n\r\n10.1 If any provision of this License is held to be invalid or \r\nunenforceable, that must not affect the validity or enforceability of \r\nthe remainder of the terms and conditions of this License and each \r\nremaining provision of this License shall be valid and enforced to the \r\nfullest extent permitted by law. \r\n\r\n10.2 This License is the entire agreement between the parties with \r\nrespect to the rights granted here over the Database. It replaces any \r\nearlier understandings, agreements or representations with respect to \r\nthe Database. \r\n\r\n10.3 If You are in breach of the terms of this License, You will not be \r\nentitled to rely on the terms of this License or to complain of any \r\nbreach by the Licensor. \r\n\r\n10.4 Choice of law. This License takes effect in and will be governed by \r\nthe laws of the relevant jurisdiction in which the License terms are \r\nsought to be enforced. If the standard suite of rights granted under \r\napplicable copyright law and Database Rights in the relevant \r\njurisdiction includes additional rights not granted under this License, \r\nthese additional rights are granted in this License in order to meet the \r\nterms of this License.",

It also means that recipients of the item may redistribute \r\nit under the same conditions they received it. \r\n\r\n1. You may make and give away verbatim copies of the source form of the \r\nStandard Version of this Package without restriction, provided that you \r\nduplicate all of the original copyright notices and associated disclaimers. \r\n\r\n2. You may apply bug fixes, portability fixes and other modifications \r\nderived from the Public Domain, or those made Freely Available, or from \r\nthe Copyright Holder. A Package modified in such a way shall still be \r\nconsidered the Standard Version. \r\n\r\n3. You may otherwise modify your copy of this Package in any way, provided \r\nthat you insert a prominent notice in each changed file stating how and \r\nwhen you changed that file, and provided that you do at least ONE of the \r\nfollowing: \r\n\r\na) place your modifications in the Public Domain or otherwise make them \r\nFreely Available, such as by posting said modifications to Usenet or an \r\nequivalent medium, or placing the modifications on a major network \r\narchive site allowing unrestricted access to them, or by allowing the \r\nCopyright Holder to include your modifications in the Standard Version \r\nof the Package. \r\n\r\nb) use the modified Package only within your corporation or organization. \r\n\r\nc) rename any non-standard executables so the names do not conflict \r\nwith standard executables, which must also be provided, and provide \r\na separate manual page for each non-standard executable that clearly \r\ndocuments how it differs from the Standard Version. \r\n\r\nd) make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder. \r\n\r\ne) permit and encourge anyone who receives a copy of the modified Package \r\npermission to make your modifications Freely Available \r\nin some specific way. \r\n\r\n\r\n4. You may distribute the programs of this Package in object code or \r\nexecutable form, provided that you do at least ONE of the following: \r\n\r\na) distribute a Standard Version of the executables and library files, \r\ntogether with instructions (in the manual page or equivalent) on where \r\nto get the Standard Version. \r\n\r\nb) accompany the distribution with the machine-readable source of \r\nthe Package with your modifications. \r\n\r\nc) give non-standard executables non-standard names, and clearly \r\ndocument the differences in manual pages (or equivalent), together \r\nwith instructions on where to get the Standard Version. \r\n\r\nd) make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder. \r\n\r\ne) offer the machine-readable source of the Package, with your \r\nmodifications, by mail order. \r\n\r\n5. You may charge a distribution fee for any distribution of this Package. \r\nIf you offer support for this Package, you may charge any fee you choose \r\nfor that support. You may not charge a license fee for the right to use \r\nthis Package itself. You may distribute this Package in aggregate with \r\nother (possibly commercial and possibly nonfree) programs as part of a \r\nlarger (possibly commercial and possibly nonfree) software distribution, \r\nand charge license fees for other parts of that software distribution, \r\nprovided that you do not advertise this Package as a product of your own. \r\nIf the Package includes an interpreter, You may embed this Package's \r\ninterpreter within an executable of yours (by linking); this shall be \r\nconstrued as a mere form of aggregation, provided that the complete \r\nStandard Version of the interpreter is so embedded. \r\n\r\n6. The scripts and library files supplied as input to or produced as \r\noutput from the programs of this Package do not automatically fall \r\nunder the copyright of this Package, but belong to whoever generated \r\nthem, and may be sold commercially, and may be aggregated with this \r\nPackage. If such scripts or library files are aggregated with this \r\nPackage via the so-called \"undump\" or \"unexec\" methods of producing a \r\nbinary executable image, then distribution of such an image shall \r\nneither be construed as a distribution of this Package nor shall it \r\nfall under the restrictions of Paragraphs 3 and 4, provided that you do \r\nnot represent such an executable image as a Standard Version of this \r\nPackage. \r\n\r\n7. C subroutines (or comparably compiled subroutines in other \r\nlanguages) supplied by you and linked into this Package in order to \r\nemulate subroutines and variables of the language defined by this \r\nPackage shall not be considered part of this Package, but are the \r\nequivalent of input as in Paragraph 6, provided these subroutines do \r\nnot change the language in any way that would cause it to fail the \r\nregression tests for the language. \r\n\r\n8. Aggregation of the Standard Version of the Package with a commercial \r\ndistribution is always permitted provided that the use of this Package \r\nis embedded; that is, when no overt attempt is made to make this Package's \r\ninterfaces visible to the end user of the commercial distribution. \r\nSuch use shall not be construed as a distribution of this Package. \r\n\r\n9.

These owners may contribute to the Commons to promote the \r\nideal of a free culture and the further production of creative, cultural \r\nand scientific works, or to gain reputation or greater distribution for \r\ntheir Work in part through the use and efforts of others. \r\n\r\nFor these and\/or other purposes and motivations, and without any \r\nexpectation of additional consideration or compensation, the person \r\nassociating CC0 with a Work (the \"Affirmer\"), to the extent that he or \r\nshe is an owner of Copyright and Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily \r\nelects to apply CC0 to the Work and publicly distribute the Work under \r\nits terms, with knowledge of his or her Copyright and Related Rights in \r\nthe Work and the meaning and intended legal effect of CC0 on those \r\nrights. \r\n\r\n1. Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may be \r\nprotected by copyright and related or neighboring rights (\"Copyright and \r\nRelated Rights\"). Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not \r\nlimited to, the following: \r\n\r\ni. the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display, \r\ncommunicate, and translate a Work; \r\n\r\nii. moral rights retained by the original author(s) and\/or performer(s); \r\n\r\niii. publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person's image or \r\nlikeness depicted in a Work; \r\n\r\niv. rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work, \r\nsubject to the limitations in paragraph 4(a), below; \r\n\r\nv. rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of \r\ndata in a Work; \r\n\r\nvi. database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96\/9\/EC of \r\nthe European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal \r\nprotection of databases, and under any national implementation thereof, \r\nincluding any amended or successor version of such directive); and \r\n\r\nvii. other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the \r\nworld based on applicable law or treaty, and any national \r\nimplementations thereof. \r\n\r\n2. Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention \r\nof, applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently, \r\nirrevocably and unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of \r\nAffirmer's Copyright and Related Rights and associated claims and causes \r\nof action, whether now known or unknown (including existing as well as \r\nfuture claims and causes of action), in the Work (i) in all territories \r\nworldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration provided by applicable law or \r\ntreaty (including future time extensions), (iii) in any current or \r\nfuture medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any purpose \r\nwhatsoever, including without limitation commercial, advertising or \r\npromotional purposes (the \"Waiver\"). Affirmer makes the Waiver for the \r\nbenefit of each member of the public at large and to the detriment of \r\nAffirmer's heirs and successors, fully intending that such Waiver shall \r\nnot be subject to revocation, rescission, cancellation, termination, or \r\nany other legal or equitable action to disrupt the quiet enjoyment of \r\nthe Work by the public as contemplated by Affirmer's express Statement \r\nof Purpose. \r\n\r\n3. Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any reason \r\nbe judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then the \r\nWaiver shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into \r\naccount Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the \r\nextent the Waiver is so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each affected \r\nperson a royalty-free, non transferable, non sublicensable, non \r\nexclusive, irrevocable and unconditional license to exercise Affirmer's \r\nCopyright and Related Rights in the Work (i) in all territories \r\nworldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration provided by applicable law or \r\ntreaty (including future time extensions), (iii) in any current or \r\nfuture medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any purpose \r\nwhatsoever, including without limitation commercial, advertising or \r\npromotional purposes (the \"License\"). The License shall be deemed \r\neffective as of the date CC0 was applied by Affirmer to the Work. Should \r\nany part of the License for any reason be judged legally invalid or \r\nineffective under applicable law, such partial invalidity or \r\nineffectiveness shall not invalidate the remainder of the License, and \r\nin such case Affirmer hereby affirms that he or she will not (i) \r\nexercise any of his or her remaining Copyright and Related Rights in the \r\nWork or (ii) assert any associated claims and causes of action with \r\nrespect to the Work, in either case contrary to Affirmer's express \r\nStatement of Purpose. \r\n\r\n4.

Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of other \r\npersons that may apply to the Work or any use thereof, including without \r\nlimitation any person's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work. \r\nFurther, Affirmer disclaims responsibility for obtaining any necessary \r\nconsents, permissions or other rights required for any use of the Work. \r\n\r\nd.

The words are different, but the goal is the same - to guarantee for all users the freedom to share and change software. If anyone wonders about the meaning of the SimPL, they should interpret it as consistent with GPL 2.0. \r\nSimple Public License (SimPL) 2.0 \r\nThe SimPL applies to the software's source and object code and comes with any rights that I have in it (other than trademarks). You agree to the SimPL by copying, distributing, or making a derivative work of the software. \r\n\r\nYou get the royalty free right to: \r\nUse the software for any purpose; \r\nMake derivative works of it (this is called a \"Derived Work\"); \r\nCopy and distribute it and any Derived Work. \r\nIf you distribute the software or a Derived Work, you must give back to the community by: \r\nProminently noting the date of any changes you make; \r\nLeaving other people's copyright notices, warranty disclaimers, and license terms in place; \r\nProviding the source code, build scripts, installation scripts, and interface definitions in a form that is easy to get and best to modify; \r\nLicensing it to everyone under SimPL, or substantially similar terms (such as GPL 2.0), without adding further restrictions to the rights provided; \r\nConspicuously announcing that it is available under that license. \r\nThere are some things that you must shoulder: \r\nYou get NO WARRANTIES. None of any kind; \r\nIf the software damages you in any way, you may only recover direct damages up to the amount you paid for it (that is zero if you did not pay anything). You may not recover any other damages, including those called \"consequential damages.\" (The state or country where you live may not allow you to limit your liability in this way, so this may not apply to you); \r\nThe SimPL continues perpetually, except that your license rights end automatically if: \r\nYou do not abide by the \"give back to the community\" terms (your licensees get to keep their rights if they abide); \r\nAnyone prevents you from distributing the software under the terms of the SimPL. \r\nLicense for the License \r\nYou may do anything that you want with the SimPL text; it's a license form to use in any way that you find helpful.

        "rf_text": "Open Data Commons - Public Domain Dedication & License (PDDL) \r\n\r\nPreamble \r\nThe Open Data Commons \ufffd Public Domain Dedication & Licence is a document intended to allow you to freely share, modify, and use this work for any purpose and without any restrictions. This licence is intended for use on databases or their contents (\"data\"), either together or individually. \r\n\r\nMany databases are covered by copyright. Some jurisdictions, mainly in Europe, have specific special rights that cover databases called the \"sui generis\" database right. Both of these sets of rights, as well as other legal rights used to protect databases and data, can create uncertainty or practical difficulty for those wishing to share databases and their underlying data but retain a limited amount of rights under a \"some rights reserved\" approach to licensing as outlined in the Science Commons Protocol for Implementing Open Access Data. As a result, this waiver and licence tries to the fullest extent possible to eliminate or fully license any rights that cover this database and data. Any Community Norms or similar statements of use of the database or data do not form a part of this document, and do not act as a contract for access or other terms of use for the database or data. \r\n\r\nThe position of the recipient of the work \r\n\r\nBecause this document places the database and its contents in or as close as possible within the public domain, there are no restrictions or requirements placed on the recipient by this document. Recipients may use this work commercially, use technical protection measures, combine this data or database with other databases or data, and share their changes and additions or keep them secret. It is not a requirement that recipients provide further users with a copy of this licence or attribute the original creator of the data or database as a source. The goal is to eliminate restrictions held by the original creator of the data and database on the use of it by others. \r\n\r\nThe position of the dedicator of the work \r\n\r\nCopyright law, as with most other law under the banner of \"intellectual property\", is inherently national law. This means that there exists several differences in how copyright and other IP rights can be relinquished, waived or licensed in the many legal jurisdictions of the world. This is despite much harmonisation of minimum levels of protection. The internet and other communication technologies span these many disparate legal jurisdictions and thus pose special difficulties for a document relinquishing and waiving intellectual property rights, including copyright and database rights, for use by the global community. Because of this feature of intellectual property law, this document first relinquishes the rights and waives the relevant rights and claims. It then goes on to license these same rights for jurisdictions or areas of law that may make it difficult to relinquish or waive rights or claims. \r\n\r\nThe purpose of this document is to enable rightsholders to place their work into the public domain. Unlike licences for free and open source software, free cultural works, or open content licences, rightsholders will not be able to \"dual license\" their work by releasing the same work under different licences. This is because they have allowed anyone to use the work in whatever way they choose. Rightsholders therefore can\u2019t re-license it under copyright or database rights on different terms because they have nothing left to license. Doing so creates truly accessible data to build rich applications and advance the progress of science and the arts. \r\n\r\nThis document can cover either or both of the database and its contents (the data). Because databases can have a wide variety of content \ufffd not just factual data \ufffd rightsholders should use the Open Data Commons \ufffd Public Domain Dedication & Licence for an entire database and its contents only if everything can be placed under the terms of this document. Because even factual data can sometimes have intellectual property rights, rightsholders should use this licence to cover both the database and its factual data when making material available under this document; even if it is likely that the data would not be covered by copyright or database rights. \r\n\r\nRightsholders can also use this document to cover any copyright or database rights claims over only a database, and leave the contents to be covered by other licences or documents. They can do this because this document refers to the \"Work\", which can be either \ufffd or both \ufffd the database and its contents. As a result, rightsholders need to clearly state what they are dedicating under this document when they dedicate it. \r\n\r\nJust like any licence or other document dealing with intellectual property, rightsholders should be aware that one can only license what one owns. Please ensure that the rights have been cleared to make this material available under this document. \r\n\r\nThis document permanently and irrevocably makes the Work available to the public for any use of any kind, and it should not be used unless the rightsholder is prepared for this to happen. \r\n\r\nPart I: Introduction \r\n\r\nThe Rightsholder (the Person holding rights or claims over the Work) agrees as follows: \r\n\r\n1.0 Definitions of Capitalised Words \r\n\r\n\"Copyright\" \ufffd Includes rights under copyright and under neighbouring rights and similarly related sets of rights under the law of the relevant jurisdiction under Section 6.4. \r\n\r\n\"Data\" \ufffd The contents of the Database, which includes the information, independent works, or other material collected into the Database offered under the terms of this Document. \r\n\r\n\"Database\" \ufffd A collection of Data arranged in a systematic or methodical way and individually accessible by electronic or other means offered under the terms of this Document. \r\n\r\n\"Database Right\" \ufffd Means rights over Data resulting from the Chapter III (\"sui generis\") rights in the Database Directive (Directive 96\/9\/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases) and any future updates as well as any similar rights available in the relevant jurisdiction under Section 6.4. \r\n\r\n\"Document\" \ufffd means this relinquishment and waiver of rights and claims and back up licence agreement. \r\n\r\n\"Person\" \ufffd Means a natural or legal person or a body of persons corporate or incorporate. \r\n\r\n\"Use\" \ufffd As a verb, means doing any act that is restricted by Copyright or Database Rights whether in the original medium or any other; and includes modifying the Work as may be technically necessary to use it in a different mode or format. This includes the right to sublicense the Work. \r\n\r\n\"Work\" \ufffd Means either or both of the Database and Data offered under the terms of this Document. \r\n\r\n\"You\" \ufffd the Person acquiring rights under the licence elements of this Document. \r\n\r\nWords in the singular include the plural and vice versa. \r\n\r\n2.0 What this document covers \r\n\r\n2.1. Legal effect of this Document. This Document is: \r\n\r\na. A dedication to the public domain and waiver of Copyright and Database Rights over the Work; and \r\n\r\nb. A licence of Copyright and Database Rights over the Work in jurisdictions that do not allow for relinquishment or waiver. \r\n\r\n2.2. Legal rights covered. \r\n\r\na. Copyright. Any copyright or neighbouring rights in the Work. Copyright law varies between jurisdictions, but is likely to cover: the Database model or schema, which is the structure, arrangement, and organisation of the Database, and can also include the Database tables and table indexes; the data entry and output sheets; and the Field names of Data stored in the Database. Copyright may also cover the Data depending on the jurisdiction and type of Data; and \r\n\r\nb. Database Rights. Database Rights only extend to the extraction and re-utilisation of the whole or a substantial part of the Data. Database Rights can apply even when there is no copyright over the Database. Database Rights can also apply when the Data is removed from the Database and is selected and arranged in a way that would not infringe any applicable copyright. \r\n\r\n2.2 Rights not covered. \r\n\r\na. This Document does not apply to computer programs used in the making or operation of the Database; \r\n\r\nb. This Document does not cover any patents over the Data or the Database. Please see Section 4.2 later in this Document for further details; and \r\n\r\nc. This Document does not cover any trade marks associated with the Database. Please see Section 4.3 later in this Document for further details. \r\n\r\nUsers of this Database are cautioned that they may have to clear other rights or consult other licences. \r\n\r\n2.3 Facts are free. The Rightsholder takes the position that factual information is not covered by Copyright. This Document however covers the Work in jurisdictions that may protect the factual information in the Work by Copyright, and to cover any information protected by Copyright that is contained in the Work. \r\n\r\nPart II: Dedication to the public domain \r\n\r\n3.0 Dedication, waiver, and licence of Copyright and Database Rights \r\n\r\n3.1 Dedication of Copyright and Database Rights to the public domain. The Rightsholder by using this Document, dedicates the Work to the public domain for the benefit of the public and relinquishes all rights in Copyright and Database Rights over the Work. \r\n\r\na. The Rightsholder realises that once these rights are relinquished, that the Rightsholder has no further rights in Copyright and Database Rights over the Work, and that the Work is free and open for others to Use. \r\n\r\nb. The Rightsholder intends for their relinquishment to cover all present and future rights in the Work under Copyright and Database Rights, whether they are vested or contingent rights, and that this relinquishment of rights covers all their heirs and successors. \r\n\r\nThe above relinquishment of rights applies worldwide and includes media and formats now known or created in the future. \r\n\r\n3.2 Waiver of rights and claims in Copyright and Database Rights when Section 3.1 dedication inapplicable. If the dedication in Section 3.1 does not apply in the relevant jurisdiction under Section 6.4, the Rightsholder waives any rights and claims that the Rightsholder may have or acquire in the future over the Work in: \r\n\r\na. Copyright; and \r\n\r\nb. Database Rights. \r\n\r\nTo the extent possible in the relevant jurisdiction, the above waiver of rights and claims applies worldwide and includes media and formats now known or created in the future. The Rightsholder agrees not to assert the above rights and waives the right to enforce them over the Work. \r\n\r\n3.3 Licence of Copyright and Database Rights when Sections 3.1 and 3.2 inapplicable. If the dedication and waiver in Sections 3.1 and 3.2 does not apply in the relevant jurisdiction under Section 6.4, the Rightsholder and You agree as follows: \r\n\r\na. The Licensor grants to You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, licence to Use the Work for the duration of any applicable Copyright and Database Rights. These rights explicitly include commercial use, and do not exclude any field of endeavour. To the extent possible in the relevant jurisdiction, these rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now known or created in the future. \r\n\r\n3.4 Moral rights. This section covers moral rights, including the right to be identified as the author of the Work or to object to treatment that would otherwise prejudice the author\u2019s honour and reputation, or any other derogatory treatment: \r\n\r\na. For jurisdictions allowing waiver of moral rights, Licensor waives all moral rights that Licensor may have in the Work to the fullest extent possible by the law of the relevant jurisdiction under Section 6.4; \r\n\r\nb. If waiver of moral rights under Section 3.4 a in the relevant jurisdiction is not possible, Licensor agrees not to assert any moral rights over the Work and waives all claims in moral rights to the fullest extent possible by the law of the relevant jurisdiction under Section 6.4; and \r\n\r\nc. For jurisdictions not allowing waiver or an agreement not to assert moral rights under Section 3.4 a and b, the author may retain their moral rights over the copyrighted aspects of the Work. \r\n\r\nPlease note that some jurisdictions do not allow for the waiver of moral rights, and so moral rights may still subsist over the work in some jurisdictions. \r\n\r\n4.0 Relationship to other rights \r\n\r\n4.1 No other contractual conditions. The Rightsholder makes this Work available to You without any other contractual obligations, either express or implied. Any Community Norms statement associated with the Work is not a contract and does not form part of this Document. \r\n\r\n4.2 Relationship to patents. This Document does not grant You a licence for any patents that the Rightsholder may own. Users of this Database are cautioned that they may have to clear other rights or consult other licences. \r\n\r\n4.3 Relationship to trade marks. This Document does not grant You a licence for any trade marks that the Rightsholder may own or that the Rightsholder may use to cover the Work. Users of this Database are cautioned that they may have to clear other rights or consult other licences. Part III: General provisions \r\n\r\n5.0 Warranties, disclaimer, and limitation of liability \r\n\r\n5.1 The Work is provided by the Rightsholder \"as is\" and without any warranty of any kind, either express or implied, whether of title, of accuracy or completeness, of the presence of absence of errors, of fitness for purpose, or otherwise. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of implied warranties, so this exclusion may not apply to You. \r\n\r\n5.2 Subject to any liability that may not be excluded or limited by law, the Rightsholder is not liable for, and expressly excludes, all liability for loss or damage however and whenever caused to anyone by any use under this Document, whether by You or by anyone else, and whether caused by any fault on the part of the Rightsholder or not. This exclusion of liability includes, but is not limited to, any special, incidental, consequential, punitive, or exemplary damages. This exclusion applies even if the Rightsholder has been advised of the possibility of such damages. \r\n\r\n5.3 If liability may not be excluded by law, it is limited to actual and direct financial loss to the extent it is caused by proved negligence on the part of the Rightsholder. \r\n\r\n6.0 General \r\n\r\n6.1 If any provision of this Document is held to be invalid or unenforceable, that must not affect the cvalidity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this Document. \r\n\r\n6.2 This Document is the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the Work covered here. It replaces any earlier understandings, agreements or representations with respect to the Work not specified here. \r\n\r\n6.3 This Document does not affect any rights that You or anyone else may independently have under any applicable law to make any use of this Work, including (for jurisdictions where this Document is a licence) fair dealing, fair use, database exceptions, or any other legally recognised limitation or exception to infringement of copyright or other applicable laws. \r\n\r\n6.4 This Document takes effect in the relevant jurisdiction in which the Document terms are sought to be enforced.

Required Notices. \r\nYou must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source Code, and this License in any documentation for the Source Code, where You describe recipients' rights relating to Covered Code. If You created one or more Modification(s), You may add your name as a Contributor to the Source Code. If it is not possible to put such notice in a particular Source Code file due to its structure, then you must include such notice in a location (such as a relevant directory file) where a user would be likely to look for such a notice. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Code.\r\n\r\nHowever, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer. \r\n\r\n3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions. \r\nYou may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the requirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered Code, and if You include a notice stating that the Source Code version of the Covered Code is available under the terms of this License, including a description of how and where You have fulfilled the obligations of Section 3.2. The notice must be conspicuously included in any notice in an Executable version, related documentation or collateral in which You describe recipients' rights relating to the Covered Code. You may distribute the Executable version of Covered Code under a license of Your choice, which may contain terms different from this License, provided that You are in compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the Executable version does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient's rights in the Source Code version from the rights set forth in this License. If You distribute the Executable version under a different license You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ from this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such terms You offer. \r\n\r\nIf you distribute executable versions containing Covered Code, you must reproduce the notice in Exhibit B in the documentation and\/or other materials provided with the product. \r\n\r\n3.7. Larger Works. \r\nYou may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other code not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code. \r\n\r\n4. INABILITY TO COMPLY DUE TO STATUTE OR REGULATION \r\n\r\nIf it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License with respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to statute or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; (b) cite the statute or regulation that prohibits you from adhering to the license; and (c) describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must be included in the LEGAL file described in Section 3.4 and must be included with all distributions of the Source Code. Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it. You must submit this LEGAL file to Red Hat for review, and You will not be able use the covered code in any means until permission is granted from Red Hat to allow for the inability to comply due to statute or regulation. \r\n\r\n5. APPLICATION OF THIS LICENSE \r\n\r\nThis License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has attached the notice in Exhibit A, and to related Covered Code. \r\n\r\nRed Hat may include Covered Code in products without such additional products becoming subject to the terms of this License, and may license such additional products on different terms from those contained in this License. \r\n\r\nRed Hat may license the Source Code of Red Hat Branded Code without Red Hat Branded Code becoming subject to the terms of this License, and may license Red Hat Branded Code on different terms from those contained in this License. Contact Red Hat for details of alternate licensing terms available. \r\n\r\n6. VERSIONS OF THE LICENSE \r\n\r\n6.1. New Versions. \r\nRed Hat may publish revised and\/or new versions of the License from time to time. Each version will be given a distinguishing version number. \r\n\r\n6.2. Effect of New Versions. \r\nOnce Covered Code has been published under a particular version of the License, You may always continue to use it under the terms of that version. You may also choose to use such Covered Code under the terms of any subsequent version of the License published by Red Hat. No one other than Red Hat has the right to modify the terms applicable to Covered Code beyond what is granted under this and subsequent Licenses. \r\n\r\n6.3. Derivative Works. \r\nIf you create or use a modified version of this License (which you may only do in order to apply it to code which is not already Covered Code governed by this License), you must (a) rename Your license so that the phrases \"ECOS\", \"eCos\", \"Red Hat\", \"RHEPL\" or any confusingly similar phrase do not appear anywhere in your license and (b) otherwise make it clear that your version of the license contains terms which differ from the Red Hat eCos Public License. (Filling in the name of the Initial Developer, Original Code or Contributor in the notice described in Exhibit A shall not of themselves be deemed to be modifications of this License.) \r\n\r\n7. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY \r\n\r\nCOVERED CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN \"AS IS\" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED CODE IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED CODE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED CODE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED CODE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER. \r\n\r\n8. TERMINATION \r\n\r\nThis License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. All sublicenses to the Covered Code which are properly granted shall survive any termination of this License. Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License shall survive. \r\n\r\n9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY \r\n\r\nUNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED CODE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO YOU OR ANY OTHER PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THAT EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. \r\n\r\n10. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS \r\n\r\nThe Covered Code is a \"commercial item,\" as that term is defined in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of \"commercial computer software\" and \"commercial computer software documentation,\" as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Code with only those rights set forth herein. \r\n\r\n11. MISCELLANEOUS \r\n\r\nThis License represents the complete agreement concerning subject matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be governed by California law provisions (except to the extent applicable law, if any, provides otherwise), excluding its conflict-of-law provisions. With respect to disputes in which at least one party is a citizen of, or an entity chartered or registered to do business in, the United States of America: (a) unless otherwise agreed in writing, all disputes relating to this License (excepting any dispute relating to intellectual property rights) shall be subject to final and binding arbitration, with the losing party paying all costs of arbitration; (b) any arbitration relating to this Agreement shall be held in Santa Clara County, California, under the auspices of JAMS\/EndDispute; and (c) any litigation relating to this Agreement shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Courts of the Northern District of California, with venue lying in Santa Clara County, California, with the losing party responsible for costs, including without limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys fees and expenses. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not apply to this License. \r\n\r\n12. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS \r\n\r\nExcept in cases where another Contributor has failed to comply with Section 3.4, You are responsible for damages arising, directly or indirectly, out of Your utilization of rights under this License, based on the number of copies of Covered Code you made available, the revenues you received from utilizing such rights, and other relevant factors. You agree to work with affected parties to distribute responsibility on an equitable basis. \r\n\r\n13. ADDITIONAL TERMS APPLICABLE TO THE RED HAT ECOS PUBLIC LICENSE \r\n\r\nNothing in this License shall be interpreted to prohibit Red Hat from licensing under different terms than this License any code which Red Hat otherwise would have a right to license. \r\n\r\nRed Hat and logo - This License does not grant any rights to use the trademark Red Hat, the Red Hat logo, eCos logo, even if such marks are included in the Original Code. You may contact Red Hat for permission to display the Red Hat and eCos marks in either the documentation or the Executable version beyond that required in Exhibit B. \r\n\r\nInability to Comply Due to Contractual Obligation - To the extent that Red Hat is limited contractually from making third party code available under this License, Red Hat may choose to integrate such third party code into Covered Code without being required to distribute such third party code in Source Code form, even if such third party code would otherwise be considered \"Modifications\" under this License. \r\n\r\nEXHIBIT A \r\n\r\n\"The contents of this file are subject to the Red Hat eCos Public License Version 1.1 (the \"License\"); you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.

The changes to the MPL are underlined. There is a license FAQ for both the MPL and the EPL, most of that is applicable to the H2 license as well.\r\n\r\nYou can use H2 for free. You can integrate it into your applications (including in commercial applications), and you can distribute it.\r\nFiles containing only your code are not covered by this license (it is 'commercial friendly').\r\nModifications to the H2 source code must be published.\r\nYou don't need to provide the source code of H2 if you did not modify anything.\r\nIf you distribute a binary that includes H2, you need to add a disclaimer of liability - see the example below.\r\nHowever, nobody is allowed to rename H2, modify it a little, and sell it as a database engine without telling the customers it is in fact H2. This happened to HSQLDB: a company called 'bungisoft' copied HSQLDB, renamed it to 'RedBase', and tried to sell it, hiding the fact that it was in fact just HSQLDB. It seems 'bungisoft' does not exist any more, but you can use the Wayback Machine and visit old web pages of http:\/\/www.bungisoft.com.\r\n\r\nAbout porting the source code to another language (for example C# or C++): converted source code (even if done manually) stays under the same copyright and license as the original code. The copyright of the ported source code does not (automatically) go to the person who ported the code.\r\n\r\nIf you distribute a binary that includes H2, you need to add the license and a disclaimer of liability (as you should do for your own code). You should add a disclaimer for each open source libraries you use. For example, add a file 3rdparty_license.txt in the directory where the jar files are, and list all open source libraries, each one with its license and disclaimer. For H2, a simple solution is to copy the following text below. You may also include a copy of the complete license.\r\nhttp:\/\/www.h2database.com\/html\/license.html#h2_license",

License Grants and Conditions \r\n-------------------------------- \r\n\r\n2.1. Grants \r\n\r\nEach Contributor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free, \r\nnon-exclusive license: \r\n\r\n(a) under intellectual property rights (other than patent or trademark) \r\nLicensable by such Contributor to use, reproduce, make available, \r\nmodify, display, perform, distribute, and otherwise exploit its \r\nContributions, either on an unmodified basis, with Modifications, or \r\nas part of a Larger Work; and \r\n\r\n(b) under Patent Claims of such Contributor to make, use, sell, offer \r\nfor sale, have made, import, and otherwise transfer either its \r\nContributions or its Contributor Version. \r\n\r\n2.2. Effective Date \r\n\r\nThe licenses granted in Section 2.1 with respect to any Contribution \r\nbecome effective for each Contribution on the date the Contributor first \r\ndistributes such Contribution. \r\n\r\n2.3. Limitations on Grant Scope \r\n\r\nThe licenses granted in this Section 2 are the only rights granted under \r\nthis License. No additional rights or licenses will be implied from the \r\ndistribution or licensing of Covered Software under this License. \r\nNotwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted by a \r\nContributor: \r\n\r\n(a) for any code that a Contributor has removed from Covered Software; \r\nor \r\n\r\n(b) for infringements caused by: (i) Your and any other third party's \r\nmodifications of Covered Software, or (ii) the combination of its \r\nContributions with other software (except as part of its Contributor \r\nVersion); or \r\n\r\n(c) under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of \r\nits Contributions. \r\n\r\nThis License does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service marks, \r\nor logos of any Contributor (except as may be necessary to comply with \r\nthe notice requirements in Section 3.4). \r\n\r\n2.4. Subsequent Licenses \r\n\r\nNo Contributor makes additional grants as a result of Your choice to \r\ndistribute the Covered Software under a subsequent version of this \r\nLicense (see Section 10.2) or under the terms of a Secondary License (if \r\npermitted under the terms of Section 3.3). \r\n\r\n2.5. Representation \r\n\r\nEach Contributor represents that the Contributor believes its \r\nContributions are its original creation(s) or it has sufficient rights \r\nto grant the rights to its Contributions conveyed by this License. \r\n\r\n2.6. Fair Use \r\n\r\nThis License is not intended to limit any rights You have under \r\napplicable copyright doctrines of fair use, fair dealing, or other \r\nequivalents. \r\n\r\n2.7. Conditions \r\n\r\nSections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 are conditions of the licenses granted \r\nin Section 2.1. \r\n\r\n3. Responsibilities \r\n------------------- \r\n\r\n3.1. Distribution of Source Form \r\n\r\nAll distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any \r\nModifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under \r\nthe terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source \r\nCode Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this \r\nLicense, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not \r\nattempt to alter or restrict the recipients' rights in the Source Code \r\nForm. \r\n\r\n3.2. Distribution of Executable Form \r\n\r\nIf You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then: \r\n\r\n(a) such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code \r\nForm, as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of \r\nthe Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code \r\nForm by reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more \r\nthan the cost of distribution to the recipient; and \r\n\r\n(b) You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this \r\nLicense, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the \r\nlicense for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter \r\nthe recipients' rights in the Source Code Form under this License. \r\n\r\n3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work \r\n\r\nYou may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice, \r\nprovided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for \r\nthe Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered \r\nSoftware with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the \r\nCovered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this \r\nLicense permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software \r\nunder the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of \r\nthe Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered \r\nSoftware under the terms of either this License or such Secondary \r\nLicense(s). \r\n\r\n3.4. Notices \r\n\r\nYou may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices \r\n(including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty, \r\nor limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of \r\nthe Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to \r\nthe extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies. \r\n\r\n3.5. Application of Additional Terms \r\n\r\nYou may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, \r\nindemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered \r\nSoftware. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on \r\nbehalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any \r\nsuch warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by \r\nYou alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any \r\nliability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, \r\nindemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional \r\ndisclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any \r\njurisdiction. \r\n\r\n4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation \r\n--------------------------------------------------- \r\n\r\nIf it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this \r\nLicense with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to \r\nstatute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with \r\nthe terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) \r\ndescribe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must \r\nbe placed in a text file included with all distributions of the Covered \r\nSoftware under this License. Except to the extent prohibited by statute \r\nor regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a \r\nrecipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it. \r\n\r\n5. Termination \r\n-------------- \r\n\r\n5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically \r\nif You fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become \r\ncompliant, then the rights granted under this License from a particular \r\nContributor are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such \r\nContributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an \r\nongoing basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the \r\nnon-compliance by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have \r\ncome back into compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular \r\nContributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor \r\nnotifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the \r\nfirst time You have received notice of non-compliance with this License \r\nfrom such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after \r\nYour receipt of the notice. \r\n\r\n5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent \r\ninfringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions, \r\ncounter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version \r\ndirectly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to \r\nYou by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section \r\n2.1 of this License shall terminate. \r\n\r\n5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all \r\nend user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which \r\nhave been validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License \r\nprior to termination shall survive termination. \r\n\r\n************************************************************************ \r\n* * \r\n* 6. Disclaimer of Warranty * \r\n* ------------------------- * \r\n* * \r\n* Covered Software is provided under this License on an \"as is\" * \r\n* basis, without warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or * \r\n* statutory, including, without limitation, warranties that the * \r\n* Covered Software is free of defects, merchantable, fit for a * \r\n* particular purpose or non-infringing. The entire risk as to the * \r\n* quality and performance of the Covered Software is with You. * \r\n* Should any Covered Software prove defective in any respect, You * \r\n* (not any Contributor) assume the cost of any necessary servicing, * \r\n* repair, or correction. This disclaimer of warranty constitutes an * \r\n* essential part of this License. No use of any Covered Software is * \r\n* authorized under this License except under this disclaimer. * \r\n* * \r\n************************************************************************ \r\n\r\n************************************************************************ \r\n* * \r\n* 7. Limitation of Liability * \r\n* -------------------------- * \r\n* * \r\n* Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort * \r\n* (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall any * \r\n* Contributor, or anyone who distributes Covered Software as * \r\n* permitted above, be liable to You for any direct, indirect, * \r\n* special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character * \r\n* including, without limitation, damages for lost profits, loss of * \r\n* goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any * \r\n* and all other commercial damages or losses, even if such party * \r\n* shall have been informed of the possibility of such damages. This * \r\n* limitation of liability shall not apply to liability for death or * \r\n* personal injury resulting from such party's negligence to the * \r\n* extent applicable law prohibits such limitation. Some * \r\n* jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of * \r\n* incidental or consequential damages, so this exclusion and * \r\n* limitation may not apply to You. * \r\n* * \r\n************************************************************************ \r\n\r\n8. Litigation \r\n------------- \r\n\r\nAny litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the \r\ncourts of a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal \r\nplace of business and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that \r\njurisdiction, without reference to its conflict-of-law provisions. \r\nNothing in this Section shall prevent a party's ability to bring \r\ncross-claims or counter-claims. \r\n\r\n9. Miscellaneous \r\n---------------- \r\n\r\nThis License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject \r\nmatter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be \r\nunenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent \r\nnecessary to make it enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides \r\nthat the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter \r\nshall not be used to construe this License against a Contributor. \r\n\r\n10. Versions of the License \r\n--------------------------- \r\n\r\n10.1. New Versions \r\n\r\nMozilla Foundation is the license steward. Except as provided in Section \r\n10.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to modify or \r\npublish new versions of this License. Each version will be given a \r\ndistinguishing version number. \r\n\r\n10.2. Effect of New Versions \r\n\r\nYou may distribute the Covered Software under the terms of the version \r\nof the License under which You originally received the Covered Software, \r\nor under the terms of any subsequent version published by the license \r\nsteward. \r\n\r\n10.3. Modified Versions \r\n\r\nIf you create software not governed by this License, and you want to \r\ncreate a new license for such software, you may create and use a \r\nmodified version of this License if you rename the license and remove \r\nany references to the name of the license steward (except to note that \r\nsuch modified license differs from this License). \r\n\r\n10.4. Distributing Source Code Form that is Incompatible With Secondary \r\nLicenses \r\n\r\nIf You choose to distribute Source Code Form that is Incompatible With \r\nSecondary Licenses under the terms of this version of the License, the \r\nnotice described in Exhibit B of this License must be attached. \r\n\r\nExhibit A - Source Code Form License Notice \r\n------------------------------------------- \r\n\r\nThis Source Code Form is subject to the terms of the Mozilla Public \r\nLicense, v. 2.0. If a copy of the MPL was not distributed with this \r\nfile, You can obtain one at http:\/\/mozilla.org\/MPL\/2.0\/. \r\n\r\nIf it is not possible or desirable to put the notice in a particular \r\nfile, then You may include the notice in a location (such as a LICENSE \r\nfile in a relevant directory) where a recipient would be likely to look \r\nfor such a notice. \r\n\r\nYou may add additional accurate notices of copyright ownership. \r\n\r\nExhibit B - \"Incompatible With Secondary Licenses\" Notice \r\n--------------------------------------------------------- \r\n\r\nThis Source Code Form is \"Incompatible With Secondary Licenses\", as \r\ndefined by the Mozilla Public License, v. 2.0.",

If you use it in a\r\nprogram, you must acknowledge somewhere in your documentation that\r\nyou've used the IJG code.\r\n\r\nIn legalese:\r\n\r\nThe authors make NO WARRANTY or representation, either express or implied,\r\nwith respect to this software, its quality, accuracy, merchantability, or\r\nfitness for a particular purpose. This software is provided \"AS IS\", and you,\r\nits user, assume the entire risk as to its quality and accuracy.\r\n\r\nThis software is copyright (C) 1991-1998, Thomas G. Lane.\r\nAll Rights Reserved except as specified below.\r\n\r\nPermission is hereby granted to use, copy, modify, and distribute this\r\nsoftware (or portions thereof) for any purpose, without fee, subject to these\r\nconditions:\r\n(1) If any part of the source code for this software is distributed, then this\r\nREADME file must be included, with this copyright and no-warranty notice\r\nunaltered; and any additions, deletions, or changes to the original files\r\nmust be clearly indicated in accompanying documentation.\r\n(2) If only executable code is distributed, then the accompanying\r\ndocumentation must state that \"this software is based in part on the work of\r\nthe Independent JPEG Group\".\r\n(3) Permission for use of this software is granted only if the user accepts\r\nfull responsibility for any undesirable consequences; the authors accept\r\nNO LIABILITY for damages of any kind.\r\n\r\nThese conditions apply to any software derived from or based on the IJG code,\r\nnot just to the unmodified library. If you use our work, you ought to\r\nacknowledge us.\r\n\r\nPermission is NOT granted for the use of any IJG author's name or company name\r\nin advertising or publicity relating to this software or products derived from\r\nit. This software may be referred to only as \"the Independent JPEG Group's\r\nsoftware\".\r\n\r\nWe specifically permit and encourage the use of this software as the basis of\r\ncommercial products, provided that all warranty or liability claims are\r\nassumed by the product vendor.\r\n\r\n\r\nansi2knr.c is included in this distribution by permission of L. Peter Deutsch,\r\nsole proprietor of its copyright holder, Aladdin Enterprises of Menlo Park, CA.\r\nansi2knr.c is NOT covered by the above copyright and conditions, but instead\r\nby the usual distribution terms of the Free Software Foundation; principally,\r\nthat you must include source code if you redistribute it. (See the file\r\nansi2knr.c for full details.) However, since ansi2knr.c is not needed as part\r\nof any program generated from the IJG code, this does not limit you more than\r\nthe foregoing paragraphs do.\r\n\r\nThe Unix configuration script \"configure\" was produced with GNU Autoconf.\r\nIt is copyright by the Free Software Foundation but is freely distributable.\r\nThe same holds for its supporting scripts (config.guess, config.sub,\r\nltconfig, ltmain.sh). Another support script, install-sh, is copyright\r\nby M.I.T. but is also freely distributable.\r\n\r\nIt appears that the arithmetic coding option of the JPEG spec is covered by\r\npatents owned by IBM, AT&T, and Mitsubishi. Hence arithmetic coding cannot\r\nlegally be used without obtaining one or more licenses. For this reason,\r\nsupport for arithmetic coding has been removed from the free JPEG software.\r\n(Since arithmetic coding provides only a marginal gain over the unpatented\r\nHuffman mode, it is unlikely that very many implementations will support it.)\r\nSo far as we are aware, there are no patent restrictions on the remaining\r\ncode.\r\n\r\nThe IJG distribution formerly included code to read and write GIF files.\r\nTo avoid entanglement with the Unisys LZW patent, GIF reading support has\r\nbeen removed altogether, and the GIF writer has been simplified to produce\r\n\"uncompressed GIFs\". This technique does not use the LZW algorithm; the\r\nresulting GIF files are larger than usual, but are readable by all standard\r\nGIF decoders.\r\n\r\nWe are required to state that\r\n\"The Graphics Interchange Format(c) is the Copyright property of\r\nCompuServe Incorporated. GIF(sm) is a Service Mark property of\r\nCompuServe Incorporated.\"",

As significant differences\r\n    exist, the complete license should be read.\r\n\r\nPREAMBLE\r\n\r\nThe intent of this document is to state the conditions under which\r\na Package may be copied, such that the Copyright Holder maintains\r\nsome semblance of artistic control over the development of the\r\npackage, while giving the users of the package the right to use\r\nand distribute the Package in a more-or-less customary fashion,\r\nplus the right to make reasonable modifications.\r\n\r\nDefinitions:\r\n\r\n    \"Package\" refers to the collection of files distributed by the\r\n    Copyright Holder, and derivatives of that collection of files\r\n    created through textual modification.\r\n\r\n    \"Standard Version\" refers to such a Package if it has not been\r\n    modified, or has been modified in accordance with the wishes\r\n    of the Copyright Holder.\r\n\r\n    \"Copyright Holder\" is whoever is named in the copyright or\r\n    copyrights for the package.\r\n\r\n    \"You\" is you, if you're thinking about copying or distributing\r\n    this Package.\r\n\r\n    \"Reasonable copying fee\" is whatever you can justify on the\r\n    basis of media cost, duplication charges, time of people\r\n    involved, and so on.  (You will not be required to justify it\r\n    to the Copyright Holder, but only to the computing community\r\n    at large as a market that must bear the fee.)\r\n\r\n    \"Freely Available\" means that no fee is charged for the item\r\n    itself, though there may be fees involved in handling the item.\r\n    It also means that recipients of the item may redistribute it\r\n    under the same conditions they received it.\r\n\r\n1. You may make and give away verbatim copies of the source form\r\nof the Standard Version of this Package without restriction, provided\r\nthat you duplicate all of the original copyright notices and\r\nassociated disclaimers.\r\n\r\n2. You may apply bug fixes, portability fixes and other modifications\r\nderived from the Public Domain or from the Copyright Holder.  A\r\nPackage modified in such a way shall still be considered the Standard\r\nVersion.\r\n\r\n3. You may otherwise modify your copy of this Package in any way,\r\nprovided that you insert a prominent notice in each changed file\r\nstating how and when you changed that file, and provided that you\r\ndo at least ONE of the following:\r\n\r\n    a) place your modifications in the Public Domain or otherwise\r\n    make them Freely Available, such as by posting said modifications\r\n    to Usenet or an equivalent medium, or placing the modifications\r\n    on a major archive site such as uunet.uu.net, or by allowing\r\n    the Copyright Holder to include your modifications in the\r\n    Standard Version of the Package.\r\n\r\n    b) use the modified Package only within your corporation or\r\n    organization.\r\n\r\n    c) rename any non-standard executables so the names do not\r\n    conflict with standard executables, which must also be provided,\r\n    and provide a separate manual page for each non-standard\r\n    executable that clearly documents how it differs from the\r\n    Standard Version.\r\n\r\n    d) make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright\r\n    Holder.\r\n\r\n4. You may distribute the programs of this Package in object code\r\nor executable form, provided that you do at least ONE of the\r\nfollowing:\r\n\r\n    a) distribute a Standard Version of the executables and library\r\n    files, together with instructions (in the manual page or\r\n    equivalent) on where to get the Standard Version.\r\n\r\n    b) accompany the distribution with the machine-readable source\r\n    of the Package with your modifications.\r\n\r\n    c) accompany any non-standard executables with their corresponding\r\n    Standard Version executables, giving the non-standard executables\r\n    non-standard names, and clearly documenting the differences in\r\n    manual pages (or equivalent), together with instructions on\r\n    where to get the Standard Version.\r\n\r\n    d) make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright\r\n    Holder.\r\n\r\n5. You may charge a reasonable copying fee for any distribution of\r\nthis Package.  You may charge any fee you choose for support of\r\nthis Package.  You may not charge a fee for this Package itself.\r\nHowever, you may distribute this Package in aggregate with other\r\n(possibly commercial) programs as part of a larger (possibly\r\ncommercial) software distribution provided that you do not advertise\r\nthis Package as a product of your own.\r\n\r\n6. The scripts and library files supplied as input to or produced\r\nas output from the programs of this Package do not automatically\r\nfall under the copyright of this Package, but belong to whomever\r\ngenerated them, and may be sold commercially, and may be aggregated\r\nwith this Package.\r\n\r\n7. C subroutines supplied by you and linked into this Package in\r\norder to emulate subroutines and variables defined by this Package\r\nshall not be considered part of this Package, but are the equivalent\r\nof input as in Paragraph 6, provided these subroutines do not change\r\nthe behavior of the Package in any way that would cause it to fail\r\nthe regression tests for the Package.\r\n\r\n8. Software supplied by you and linked with this Package in order\r\nto use subroutines and variables defined by this Package shall not\r\nbe considered part of this Package and do not automatically fall\r\nunder the copyright of this Package.  Executables produced\r\nby linking your software with this Package may be used and\r\nredistributed without restriction and may be sold commercially\r\nso long as the primary function of your software is different\r\nthan the package itself.\r\n\r\n9.

All references to Apple, Apple Computer, and any other Apple trademarks or copyrights have been modified or removed.\r\n\r\n1. General; Definitions. This License applies to any program or other work which Mike Ferris makes publicly available and which contains a notice placed by Mike Ferris identifying such program or work as \"Original Code\" and stating that it is subject to the terms of this Ferris Public Source License version 1.2 (or subsequent version thereof) (\"License\"). As used in this License:\r\n\r\n1.1 \"Applicable Patent Rights\" mean: (a) in the case where Mike Ferris is the grantor of rights, (i) claims of patents that are now or hereafter acquired, owned by or assigned to Mike Ferris and (ii) that cover subject matter contained in the Original Code, but only to the extent necessary to use, reproduce and\/or distribute the Original Code without infringement; and (b) in the case where You are the grantor of rights, (i) claims of patents that are now or hereafter acquired, owned by or assigned to You and (ii) that cover subject matter in Your Modifications, taken alone or in combination with Original Code.\r\n\r\n1.2 \"Contributor\" means any person or entity that creates or contributes to the creation of Modifications.\r\n\r\n1.3 \"Covered Code\" means the Original Code, Modifications, the combination of Original Code and any Modifications, and\/or any respective portions thereof.\r\n\r\n1.4 \"Deploy\" means to use, sublicense or distribute Covered Code other than for Your internal research and development (R&D) and\/or Personal Use, and includes without limitation, any and all internal use or distribution of Covered Code within Your business or organization except for R&D use and\/or Personal Use, as well as direct or indirect sublicensing or distribution of Covered Code by You to any third party in any form or manner.\r\n\r\n1.5 \"Larger Work\" means a work which combines Covered Code or portions thereof with code not governed by the terms of this License.\r\n\r\n1.6 \"Modifications\" mean any addition to, deletion from, and\/or change to, the substance and\/or structure of the Original Code, any previous Modifications, the combination of Original Code and any previous Modifications, and\/or any respective portions thereof. When code is released as a series of files, a Modification is: (a) any addition to or deletion from the contents of a file containing Covered Code; and\/or (b) any new file or other representation of computer program statements that contains any part of Covered Code.\r\n\r\n1.7 \"Original Code\" means (a) the Source Code of a program or other work as originally made available by Mike Ferris under this License, including the Source Code of any updates or upgrades to such programs or works made available by Mike Ferris under this License, and that has been expressly identified by Mike Ferris as such in the header file(s) of such work; and (b) the object code compiled from such Source Code and originally made available by Mike Ferris under this License.\r\n\r\n1.8 \"Personal Use\" means use of Covered Code by an individual solely for his or her personal, private and non-commercial purposes. An individual's use of Covered Code in his or her capacity as an officer, employee, member, independent contractor or agent of a corporation, business or organization (commercial or non-commercial) does not qualify as Personal Use.\r\n\r\n1.9 \"Source Code\" means the human readable form of a program or other work that is suitable for making modifications to it, including all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition files, scripts used to control compilation and installation of an executable (object code).\r\n\r\n1.10 \"You\" or \"Your\" means an individual or a legal entity exercising rights under this License.

Permitted Uses; Conditions & Restrictions. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, Mike Ferris hereby grants You, effective on the date You accept this License and download the Original Code, a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive license, to the extent of Mike Ferris' Applicable Patent Rights and copyrights covering the Original Code, to do the following:\r\n\r\n2.1 You may use, reproduce, display, perform, modify and distribute Original Code, with or without Modifications, solely for Your internal research and development and\/or Personal Use, provided that in each instance:\r\n\r\n(a) You must retain and reproduce in all copies of Original Code the copyright and other proprietary notices and disclaimers of Mike Ferris as they appear in the Original Code, and keep intact all notices in the Original Code that refer to this License; and\r\n\r\n(b) You must include a copy of this License with every copy of Source Code of Covered Code and documentation You distribute, and You may not offer or impose any terms on such Source Code that alter or restrict this License or the recipients' rights hereunder, except as permitted under Section 6.\r\n\r\n2.2 You may use, reproduce, display, perform, modify and Deploy Covered Code, provided that in each instance:\r\n\r\n(a) You must satisfy all the conditions of Section 2.1 with respect to the Source Code of the Covered Code;\r\n\r\n(b) You must duplicate, to the extent it does not already exist, the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source Code of all Your Modifications, and cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that You changed the files and the date of any change;\r\n\r\n(c) You must make Source Code of all Your Deployed Modifications publicly available under the terms of this License, including the license grants set forth in Section 3 below, for as long as you Deploy the Covered Code or twelve (12) months from the date of initial Deployment, whichever is longer. You should preferably distribute the Source Code of Your Deployed Modifications electronically (e.g. download from a web site); and\r\n\r\n(d) if You Deploy Covered Code in object code, executable form only, You must include a prominent notice, in the code itself as well as in related documentation, stating that Source Code of the Covered Code is available under the terms of this License with information on how and where to obtain such Source Code.\r\n\r\n2.3 You expressly acknowledge and agree that although Mike Ferris and each Contributor grants the licenses to their respective portions of the Covered Code set forth herein, no assurances are provided by Mike Ferris or any Contributor that the Covered Code does not infringe the patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity. Mike Ferris and each Contributor disclaim any liability to You for claims brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, You hereby assume sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party patent license is required to allow You to distribute the Covered Code, it is Your responsibility to acquire that license before distributing the Covered Code.\r\n\r\n3. Your Grants. In consideration of, and as a condition to, the licenses granted to You under this License:\r\n\r\n(a) You hereby grant to Mike Ferris and all third parties a non-exclusive, royalty-free license, under Your Applicable Patent Rights and other intellectual property rights (other than patent) owned or controlled by You, to use, reproduce, display, perform, modify, distribute and Deploy Your Modifications of the same scope and extent as Mike Ferris' licenses under Sections 2.1 and 2.2; and\r\n\r\n(b) You hereby grant to Mike Ferris a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free, perpetual and irrevocable license, under Your Applicable Patent Rights and other intellectual property rights (other than patent) owned or controlled by You, to use, reproduce, display, perform, modify or have modified (for Mike Ferris), sublicense and distribute Your Modifications, in any form, through multiple tiers of distribution.\r\n\r\n4. Larger Works. You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other code not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In each such instance, You must make sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code or any portion thereof.\r\n\r\n5. Limitations on Patent License. Except as expressly stated in Section 2, no other patent rights, express or implied, are granted by Mike Ferris herein. Modifications and\/or Larger Works may require additional patent licenses from Mike Ferris which Mike Ferris may grant in his sole discretion.\r\n\r\n6. Additional Terms. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations and\/or other rights consistent with the scope of the license granted herein (\"Additional Terms\") to one or more recipients of Covered Code. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf and as Your sole responsibility, and not on behalf of Mike Ferris or any Contributor. You must obtain the recipient's agreement that any such Additional Terms are offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify, defend and hold Mike Ferris and every Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by or claims asserted against Mike Ferris or such Contributor by reason of any such Additional Terms.\r\n\r\n7. Versions of the License. Mike Ferris may publish revised and\/or new versions of this License from time to time. Each version will be given a distinguishing version number. Once Original Code has been published under a particular version of this License, You may continue to use it under the terms of that version. You may also choose to use such Original Code under the terms of any subsequent version of this License published by Mike Ferris. No one other than Mike Ferris has the right to modify the terms applicable to Covered Code created under this License.\r\n\r\n8. NO WARRANTY OR SUPPORT. The Covered Code may contain in whole or in part pre-release, untested, or not fully tested works. The Covered Code may contain errors that could cause failures or loss of data, and may be incomplete or contain inaccuracies. You expressly acknowledge and agree that use of the Covered Code, or any portion thereof, is at Your sole and entire risk. THE COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\" AND WITHOUT WARRANTY, UPGRADES OR SUPPORT OF ANY KIND AND MIKE FERRIS AND MIKE FERRIS' LICENSOR(S) (COLLECTIVELY REFERRED TO AS MIKE FERRIS FOR THE PURPOSES OF SECTIONS 8 AND 9) AND ALL CONTRIBUTORS EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES AND\/OR CONDITIONS, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES AND\/OR CONDITIONS OF MERCHANTABILITY, OF SATISFACTORY QUALITY, OF FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OF ACCURACY, OF QUIET ENJOYMENT, AND NONINFRINGEMENT OF THIRD PARTY RIGHTS. MIKE FERRIS AND EACH CONTRIBUTOR DOES NOT WARRANT AGAINST INTERFERENCE WITH YOUR ENJOYMENT OF THE COVERED CODE, THAT THE FUNCTIONS CONTAINED IN THE COVERED CODE WILL MEET YOUR REQUIREMENTS, THAT THE OPERATION OF THE COVERED CODE WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR-FREE, OR THAT DEFECTS IN THE COVERED CODE WILL BE CORRECTED. NO ORAL OR WRITTEN INFORMATION OR ADVICE GIVEN BY MIKE FERRIS OR ANY CONTRIBUTOR SHALL CREATE A WARRANTY. You acknowledge that the Covered Code is not intended for use in the operation of nuclear facilities, aircraft navigation, communication systems, or air traffic control machines in which case the failure of the Covered Code could lead to death, personal injury, or severe physical or environmental damage.\r\n\r\n9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. TO THE EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL MIKE FERRIS OR ANY CONTRIBUTOR BE LIABLE FOR ANY INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, INDIRECT OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS LICENSE OR YOUR USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE COVERED CODE, OR ANY PORTION THEREOF, WHETHER UNDER A THEORY OF CONTRACT, WARRANTY, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), PRODUCTS LIABILITY OR OTHERWISE, EVEN IF MIKE FERRIS OR SUCH CONTRIBUTOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES AND NOTWITHSTANDING THE FAILURE OF ESSENTIAL PURPOSE OF ANY REMEDY. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE LIMITATION OF LIABILITY OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. In no event shall Mike Ferris' total liability to You for all damages (other than as may be required by applicable law) under this License exceed the amount of fifty dollars ($50.00).\r\n\r\n10. Trademarks. This License does not grant any rights to use any trademarks or trade names belonging to Mike Ferris or to any trademark or trade name belonging to any Contributor. No such trademarks or trade names may be used to endorse or promote products derived from the Original Code other than by explicit written permission from Mike Ferris or the Contributor who owns the trademark or trade name.\r\n\r\n11. Ownership. Subject to the licenses granted under this License, each Contributor retains all rights, title and interest in and to any Modifications made by such Contributor. Mike Ferris retains all rights, title and interest in and to the Original Code and any Modifications made by or on behalf of Mike Ferris (\"Mike Ferris Modifications\"), and such Mike Ferris Modifications will not be automatically subject to this License. Mike Ferris may, at his sole discretion, choose to license such Mike Ferris Modifications under this License, or on different terms from those contained in this License or may choose not to license them at all.\r\n\r\n12. Termination.\r\n\r\n12.1 Termination. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate:\r\n\r\n(a) automatically without notice from Mike Ferris if You fail to comply with any term(s) of this License and fail to cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of such breach;\r\n\r\n(b) immediately in the event of the circumstances described in Section 13.5(b); or\r\n\r\n(c) automatically without notice from Mike Ferris if You, at any time during the term of this License, commence an action for patent infringement against Mike Ferris.\r\n\r\n12.2 Effect of Termination. Upon termination, You agree to immediately stop any further use, reproduction, modification, sublicensing and distribution of the Covered Code and to destroy all copies of the Covered Code that are in your possession or control. All sublicenses to the Covered Code which have been properly granted prior to termination shall survive any termination of this License. Provisions which, by their nature, should remain in effect beyond the termination of this License shall survive, including but not limited to Sections 3, 5, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12.2 and 13. No party will be liable to any other for compensation, indemnity or damages of any sort solely as a result of terminating this License in accordance with its terms, and termination of this License will be without prejudice to any other right or remedy of any party.\r\n\r\n13. Miscellaneous.\r\n\r\n13.1 Government End Users. The Covered Code is a \"commercial item\" as defined in FAR 2.101. Government software and technical data rights in the Covered Code include only those rights customarily provided to the public as defined in this License. This customary commercial license in technical data and software is provided in accordance with FAR 12.211 (Technical Data) and 12.212 (Computer Software) and, for Department of Defense purchases, DFAR 252.227-7015 (Technical Data -- Commercial Items) and 227.7202-3 (Rights in Commercial Computer Software or Computer Software Documentation). Accordingly, all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Code with only those rights set forth herein.\r\n\r\n13.2 Relationship of Parties. This License will not be construed as creating an agency, partnership, joint venture or any other form of legal association between or among You, Mike Ferris or any Contributor, and You will not represent to the contrary, whether expressly, by implication, appearance or otherwise.\r\n\r\n13.3 Independent Development. Nothing in this License will impair Mike Ferris' right to acquire, license, develop, have others develop for it, market and\/or distribute technology or products that perform the same or similar functions as, or otherwise compete with, Modifications, Larger Works, technology or products that You may develop, produce, market or distribute.\r\n\r\n13.4 Waiver; Construction. Failure by Mike Ferris or any Contributor to enforce any provision of this License will not be deemed a waiver of future enforcement of that or any other provision. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter will not apply to this License.\r\n\r\n13.5 Severability. (a) If for any reason a court of competent jurisdiction finds any provision of this License, or portion thereof, to be unenforceable, that provision of the License will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible so as to effect the economic benefits and intent of the parties, and the remainder of this License will continue in full force and effect. (b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if applicable law prohibits or restricts You from fully and\/or specifically complying with Sections 2 and\/or 3 or prevents the enforceability of either of those Sections, this License will immediately terminate and You must immediately discontinue any use of the Covered Code and destroy all copies of it that are in your possession or control.\r\n\r\n13.6 Dispute Resolution. Any litigation or other dispute resolution between You and Mike Ferris relating to this License shall take place in the Northern District of California, and You and Mike Ferris hereby consent to the personal jurisdiction of, and venue in, the state and federal courts within that District with respect to this License. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded.\r\n\r\n13.7 Entire Agreement; Governing Law. This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof. This License shall be governed by the laws of the United States and the State of California, except that body of California law concerning conflicts of law.\r\n\r\nWhere You are located in the province of Quebec, Canada, the following clause applies: The parties hereby confirm that they have requested that this License and all related documents be drafted in English. Les parties ont exig\u00e9 que le pr\u00e9sent contrat et tous les documents connexes soient r\u00e9dig\u00e9s en anglais.\r\n\r\nEXHIBIT A.\r\n\r\n\"Portions Copyright (c) 1996-2002 Mike Ferris.

Distribution Obligations. \r\no 3.1. Application of License. \r\nThe Modifications which You create or to which You contribute are governed by the terms of this License, including without limitation Section 2.2. The Source Code version of Covered Code may be distributed only under the terms of this License or a future version of this License released under Section 6.1, and You must include a copy of this License with every copy of the Source Code You distribute. You may not offer or impose any terms on any Source Code version that alters or restricts the applicable version of this License or the recipients' rights hereunder. However, You may include an additional document offering the additional rights described in Section 3.5. \r\no 3.2. Availability of Source Code. \r\nAny Modification which You create or to which You contribute must be made available in Source Code form under the terms of this License either on the same media as an Executable version or via an accepted Electronic Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom you made an Executable version available; and if made available via Electronic Distribution Mechanism, must remain available for at least twelve (12) months after the date it initially became available, or at least six (6) months after a subsequent version of that particular Modification has been made available to such recipients. You are responsible for ensuring that the Source Code version remains available even if the Electronic Distribution Mechanism is maintained by a third party. \r\no 3.3. Description of Modifications. \r\nYou must cause all Covered Code to which You contribute to contain a file documenting the changes You made to create that Covered Code and the date of any change. You must include a prominent statement that the Modification is derived, directly or indirectly, from Original Code provided by the Initial Developer and including the name of the Initial Developer in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in any notice in an Executable version or related documentation in which You describe the origin or ownership of the Covered Code. \r\no 3.4. Intellectual Property Matters \r\n+ (a) Third Party Claims. \r\nIf Contributor has knowledge that a license under a third party's intellectual property rights is required to exercise the rights granted by such Contributor under Sections 2.1 or 2.2, Contributor must include a text file with the Source Code distribution titled \"LEGAL\" which describes the claim and the party making the claim in sufficient detail that a recipient will know whom to contact. If Contributor obtains such knowledge after the Modification is made available as described in Section 3.2, Contributor shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies Contributor makes available thereafter and shall take other steps (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably calculated to inform those who received the Covered Code that new knowledge has been obtained. \r\n+ (b) Contributor APIs. \r\nIf Contributor's Modifications include an application programming interface and Contributor has knowledge of patent licenses which are reasonably necessary to implement that API, Contributor must also include this information in the LEGAL file. \r\n+ (c) Representations. \r\nContributor represents that, except as disclosed pursuant to Section 3.4(a) above, Contributor believes that Contributor's Modifications are Contributor's original creation(s) and\/or Contributor has sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by this License. \r\no 3.5. Required Notices. \r\nYou must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source Code. If it is not possible to put such notice in a particular Source Code file due to its structure, then You must include such notice in a location (such as a relevant directory) where a user would be likely to look for such a notice. If You created one or more Modification(s) You may add your name as a Contributor to the notice described in Exhibit A. You must also duplicate this License in any documentation for the Source Code where You describe recipients' rights or ownership rights relating to Covered Code. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Code. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear than any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer. \r\no 3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions. \r\nYou may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the requirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered Code, and if You include a notice stating that the Source Code version of the Covered Code is available under the terms of this License, including a description of how and where You have fulfilled the obligations of Section 3.2. The notice must be conspicuously included in any notice in an Executable version, related documentation or collateral in which You describe recipients' rights relating to the Covered Code. You may distribute the Executable version of Covered Code or ownership rights under a license of Your choice, which may contain terms different from this License, provided that You are in compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the Executable version does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient's rights in the Source Code version from the rights set forth in this License. If You distribute the Executable version under a different license You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ from this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such terms You offer. \r\no 3.7. Larger Works. \r\nYou may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other code not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code. \r\n* 4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation. \r\no If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License with respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must be included in the LEGAL file described in Section 3.4 and must be included with all distributions of the Source Code. Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.\r\n* 5. Application of this License. \r\no This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has attached the notice in Exhibit A and to related Covered Code. \r\n* 6. Versions of the License. \r\no 6.1. New Versions. Zimbra, Inc. (\"Zimbra\") may publish revised and\/or new versions of the License from time to time. Each version will be given a distinguishing version number. \r\no 6.2. Effect of New Versions. Once Covered Code has been published under a particular version of the License, You may always continue to use it under the terms of that version. You may also choose to use such Covered Code under the terms of any subsequent version of the License published by Zimbra. No one other than Zimbra has the right to modify the terms applicable to Covered Code created under this License. \r\no 6.3. Derivative Works. If You create or use a modified version of this License (which you may only do in order to apply it to code which is not already Covered Code governed by this License), You must (a) rename Your license so that the phrases \"Zimbra\", \"ZPL\" or any confusingly similar phrase do not appear in your license (except to note that your license differs from this License) and (b) otherwise make it clear that Your version of the license contains terms which differ from the Zimbra Public License. (Filling in the name of the Initial Developer, Original Code or Contributor in the notice described in Exhibit A shall not of themselves be deemed to be modifications of this License.) \r\n* 7. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY. \r\no COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN \"AS IS\" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED CODE IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED CODE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED CODE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED CODE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER. \r\n* 8. TERMINATION. \r\no 8.1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. All sublicenses to the Covered Code which are properly granted shall survive any termination of this License. Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License shall survive. \r\no 8.2. If You initiate litigation by asserting a patent infringement claim (excluding declatory judgment actions) against Initial Developer or a Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom You file such action is referred to as \"Participant\") alleging that: \r\n+ (a) such Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted by such Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and\/or 2.2 of this License shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate prospectively, unless if within 60 days after receipt of notice You either: (i) agree in writing to pay Participant a mutually agreeable reasonable royalty for Your past and future use of Modifications made by such Participant, or (ii) withdraw Your litigation claim with respect to the Contributor Version against such Participant. If within 60 days of notice, a reasonable royalty and payment arrangement are not mutually agreed upon in writing by the parties or the litigation claim is not withdrawn, the rights granted by Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and\/or 2.2 automatically terminate at the expiration of the 60 day notice period specified above. \r\n+ (b) any software, hardware, or device, other than such Participant's Contributor Version, directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any rights granted to You by such Participant under Sections 2.1(b) and 2.2(b) are revoked effective as of the date You first made, used, sold, distributed, or had made, Modifications made by that Participant. \r\no 8.3. If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant alleging that such Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as by license or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses granted by such Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken into account in determining the amount or value of any payment or license. \r\no 8.4. In the event of termination under Sections 8.1 or 8.2 above, all end-user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder prior to termination shall survive termination. \r\n* 9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. \r\no UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED CODE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. \r\n* 10. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS. \r\no The Covered Code is a \"commercial item,\" as that term is defined in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of \"commercial computer software\" and \"commercial computer software documentation,\" as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S. Government End-Users acquire Covered Code with only those rights set forth herein. \r\n* 11. MISCELLANEOUS. \r\no This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be governed by California law provisions (except to the extent applicable law, if any, provides otherwise), excluding its conflict-of-law provisions. With respect to disputes in which at least one party is a citizen of, or an entity chartered or registered to do business in the United States of America, any litigation relating to this License shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Courts of the Northern District of California, with venue lying in Santa Clara County, California, with the losing party responsible for costs, including without limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not apply to this License. \r\n* 12. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS. \r\no As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly, out of its utilization of rights under this License and You agree to work with Initial Developer and Contributors to distribute such responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing herein is intended or shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability. \r\n* 13. MULTIPLE-LICENSED CODE. \r\no Initial Developer may designate portions of the Covered Code as Multiple-Licensed.

Since wireless LANs are\r\ngenerally unlicensed devices that share spectrum with radars,\r\nsatellites, and other licensed and unlicensed devices, it is sometimes\r\nnecessary to dynamically detect, avoid, and limit usage to avoid\r\ninterference with these devices. In many instances Intel is required to\r\nprovide test data to prove regional and local compliance to regional and\r\ngovernmental regulations before certification or approval to use the\r\nproduct is granted. Intel's wireless LAN's EEPROM, firmware, \r\nmicrocode, and software driver are designed to carefully control \r\nparameters that affect radio operation and to ensure electromagnetic \r\ncompliance (EMC). These parameters include, without limitation, RF \r\npower, spectrum usage, channel scanning, and human exposure.\r\n\r\nFor these reasons Intel cannot permit any manipulation by third parties\r\nof the software provided in binary format with the wireless WLAN\r\nadapters (e.g., the EEPROM, regulatory daemon, and microcode). Furthermore, \r\nif you use any patches, utilities, or code with the Intel wireless LAN \r\nadapters that have been manipulated by an unauthorized party (i.e., \r\npatches, utilities, or code (including open source code modifications) \r\nwhich have not been validated by Intel), \r\n\r\n  (i) you will be solely responsible for ensuring the regulatory \r\n      compliance of the products, \r\n (ii) Intel will bear no liability, under any theory of liability for \r\n      any issues associated with the modified products, including \r\n      without limitation, claims under the warranty and\/or issues \r\n      arising from regulatory non-compliance, and\r\n(iii) Intel will not provide or be required to assist in providing\r\n      support to any third parties for such modified products.\r\n\r\nNote: Many regulatory agencies consider Wireless LAN adapters to be\r\nmodules, and accordingly, condition system-level regulatory approval\r\nupon receipt and review of test data documenting that the antennas and\r\nsystem configuration do not cause the EMC and radio operation to be\r\nnon-compliant.",

The following considerations are for informational purposes only, are not exhaustive, and do not form part of our licenses.\r\n\r\nConsiderations for licensors: Our public licenses are intended for use by those authorized to give the public permission to use material in ways otherwise restricted by copyright and certain other rights. Our licenses are irrevocable. Licensors should read and understand the terms and conditions of the license they choose before applying it. Licensors should also secure all rights necessary before applying our licenses so that the public can reuse the material as expected. Licensors should clearly mark any material not subject to the license. This includes other CC-licensed material, or material used under an exception or limitation to copyright. More considerations for licensors.\r\nConsiderations for the public: By using one of our public licenses, a licensor grants the public permission to use the licensed material under specified terms and conditions. If the licensor\u2019s permission is not necessary for any reason\u2013for example, because of any applicable exception or limitation to copyright\u2013then that use is not regulated by the license. Our licenses grant only permissions under copyright and certain other rights that a licensor has authority to grant. Use of the licensed material may still be restricted for other reasons, including because others have copyright or other rights in the material. A licensor may make special requests, such as asking that all changes be marked or described. Although not required by our licenses, you are encouraged to respect those requests where reasonable. More considerations for the public.\r\nCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 International Public License\r\n\r\nBy exercising the Licensed Rights (defined below), You accept and agree to be bound by the terms and conditions of this Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International Public License (\"Public License\"). To the extent this Public License may be interpreted as a contract, You are granted the Licensed Rights in consideration of Your acceptance of these terms and conditions, and the Licensor grants You such rights in consideration of benefits the Licensor receives from making the Licensed Material available under these terms and conditions.\r\n\r\nSection 1 \u2013 Definitions.\r\n\r\nAdapted Material means material subject to Copyright and Similar Rights that is derived from or based upon the Licensed Material and in which the Licensed Material is translated, altered, arranged, transformed, or otherwise modified in a manner requiring permission under the Copyright and Similar Rights held by the Licensor. For purposes of this Public License, where the Licensed Material is a musical work, performance, or sound recording, Adapted Material is always produced where the Licensed Material is synched in timed relation with a moving image.\r\nAdapter's License means the license You apply to Your Copyright and Similar Rights in Your contributions to Adapted Material in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Public License.\r\nCopyright and Similar Rights means copyright and\/or similar rights closely related to copyright including, without limitation, performance, broadcast, sound recording, and Sui Generis Database Rights, without regard to how the rights are labeled or categorized. For purposes of this Public License, the rights specified in Section 2(b)(1)-(2) are not Copyright and Similar Rights.\r\nEffective Technological Measures means those measures that, in the absence of proper authority, may not be circumvented under laws fulfilling obligations under Article 11 of the WIPO Copyright Treaty adopted on December 20, 1996, and\/or similar international agreements.\r\nExceptions and Limitations means fair use, fair dealing, and\/or any other exception or limitation to Copyright and Similar Rights that applies to Your use of the Licensed Material.\r\nLicensed Material means the artistic or literary work, database, or other material to which the Licensor applied this Public License.\r\nLicensed Rights means the rights granted to You subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License, which are limited to all Copyright and Similar Rights that apply to Your use of the Licensed Material and that the Licensor has authority to license.\r\nLicensor means the individual(s) or entity(ies) granting rights under this Public License.\r\nShare means to provide material to the public by any means or process that requires permission under the Licensed Rights, such as reproduction, public display, public performance, distribution, dissemination, communication, or importation, and to make material available to the public including in ways that members of the public may access the material from a place and at a time individually chosen by them.\r\nSui Generis Database Rights means rights other than copyright resulting from Directive 96\/9\/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases, as amended and\/or succeeded, as well as other essentially equivalent rights anywhere in the world.\r\nYou means the individual or entity exercising the Licensed Rights under this Public License.

The term of this Public License is specified in Section 6(a).\r\nMedia and formats; technical modifications allowed.

The Licensor waives and\/or agrees not to assert any right or authority to forbid You from making technical modifications necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License, simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)(4) never produces Adapted Material.\r\nDownstream recipients.\r\nOffer from the Licensor \u2013 Licensed Material. Every recipient of the Licensed Material automatically receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this Public License.\r\nNo downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose any additional or different terms or conditions on, or apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed Material.\r\nNo endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by, the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).\r\nOther rights.\r\n\r\nMoral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity, privacy, and\/or other similar personality rights; however, to the extent possible, the Licensor waives and\/or agrees not to assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed Rights, but not otherwise.\r\nPatent and trademark rights are not licensed under this Public License.\r\nTo the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly reserves any right to collect such royalties.\r\nSection 3 \u2013 License Conditions.\r\n\r\nYour exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the following conditions.\r\n\r\nAttribution.\r\n\r\nIf You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified form), You must:\r\n\r\nretain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor with the Licensed Material:\r\nidentification of the creator(s) of the Licensed Material and any others designated to receive attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by the Licensor (including by pseudonym if designated);\r\na copyright notice;\r\na notice that refers to this Public License;\r\na notice that refers to the disclaimer of warranties;\r\na URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the extent reasonably practicable;\r\nindicate if You modified the Licensed Material and retain an indication of any previous modifications; and\r\nindicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this Public License, and include the text of, or the URI or hyperlink to, this Public License.\r\nYou may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it may be reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or hyperlink to a resource that includes the required information.\r\nIf requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent reasonably practicable.\r\nIf You Share Adapted Material You produce, the Adapter's License You apply must not prevent recipients of the Adapted Material from complying with this Public License.\r\nSection 4 \u2013 Sui Generis Database Rights.\r\n\r\nWhere the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that apply to Your use of the Licensed Material:\r\n\r\nfor the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database;\r\nif You include all or a substantial portion of the database contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material; and\r\nYou must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database.\r\nFor the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not replace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed Rights include other Copyright and Similar Rights.\r\nSection 5 \u2013 Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.\r\n\r\n Unless otherwise separately undertaken by the Licensor, to the extent possible, the Licensor offers the Licensed Material as-is and as-available, and makes no representations or warranties of any kind concerning the Licensed Material, whether express, implied, statutory, or other. This includes, without limitation, warranties of title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement, absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or the presence or absence of errors, whether or not known or discoverable. Where disclaimers of warranties are not allowed in full or in part, this disclaimer may not apply to You.\r\n To the extent possible, in no event will the Licensor be liable to You on any legal theory (including, without limitation, negligence) or otherwise for any direct, special, indirect, incidental, consequential, punitive, exemplary, or other losses, costs, expenses, or damages arising out of this Public License or use of the Licensed Material, even if the Licensor has been advised of the possibility of such losses, costs, expenses, or damages. Where a limitation of liability is not allowed in full or in part, this limitation may not apply to You.\r\nThe disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and waiver of all liability.\r\nSection 6 \u2013 Term and Termination.\r\n\r\nThis Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License terminate automatically.\r\nWhere Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under Section 6(a), it reinstates:\r\n\r\nautomatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the violation; or\r\nupon express reinstatement by the Licensor.\r\nFor the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations of this Public License.\r\nFor the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so will not terminate this Public License.\r\nSections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public License.\r\nSection 7 \u2013 Other Terms and Conditions.\r\n\r\nThe Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.\r\nAny arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License.\r\nSection 8 \u2013 Interpretation.\r\n\r\nFor the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully be made without permission under this Public License.\r\nTo the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and conditions.\r\nNo term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the Licensor.\r\nNothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal processes of any jurisdiction or authority.\r\nCreative Commons is not a party to its public licenses. Notwithstanding, Creative Commons may elect to apply one of its public licenses to material it publishes and in those instances will be considered the \u201cLicensor.\u201d Except for the limited purpose of indicating that material is shared under a Creative Commons public license or as otherwise permitted by the Creative Commons policies published at creativecommons.org\/policies, Creative Commons does not authorize the use of the trademark \u201cCreative Commons\u201d or any other trademark or logo of Creative Commons without its prior written consent including, without limitation, in connection with any unauthorized modifications to any of its public licenses or any other arrangements, understandings, or agreements concerning use of licensed material.

Where disclaimers of warranties are not allowed in full or in part, this disclaimer may not apply to You.\r\n To the extent possible, in no event will the Licensor be liable to You on any legal theory (including, without limitation, negligence) or otherwise for any direct, special, indirect, incidental, consequential, punitive, exemplary, or other losses, costs, expenses, or damages arising out of this Public License or use of the Licensed Material, even if the Licensor has been advised of the possibility of such losses, costs, expenses, or damages. Where a limitation of liability is not allowed in full or in part, this limitation may not apply to You.\r\nThe disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and waiver of all liability.\r\nSection 6 \u2013 Term and Termination.\r\n\r\nThis Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License terminate automatically.\r\nWhere Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under Section 6(a), it reinstates:\r\n\r\nautomatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the violation; or\r\nupon express reinstatement by the Licensor.\r\nFor the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations of this Public License.\r\nFor the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so will not terminate this Public License.\r\nSections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public License.\r\nSection 7 \u2013 Other Terms and Conditions.\r\n\r\nThe Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.\r\nAny arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License.\r\nSection 8 \u2013 Interpretation.\r\n\r\nFor the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully be made without permission under this Public License.\r\nTo the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable.

The Licensor waives and\/or agrees not to assert any right or authority to forbid You from making technical modifications necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective Technological Measures.

In all other cases the Licensor expressly reserves any right to collect such royalties.\r\nSection 3 \u2013 License Conditions.\r\n\r\nYour exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the following conditions.\r\n\r\nAttribution.\r\n\r\nIf You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified form), You must:\r\n\r\nretain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor with the Licensed Material:\r\nidentification of the creator(s) of the Licensed Material and any others designated to receive attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by the Licensor (including by pseudonym if designated);\r\na copyright notice;\r\na notice that refers to this Public License;\r\na notice that refers to the disclaimer of warranties;\r\na URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the extent reasonably practicable;\r\nindicate if You modified the Licensed Material and retain an indication of any previous modifications; and\r\nindicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this Public License, and include the text of, or the URI or hyperlink to, this Public License.\r\nYou may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it may be reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or hyperlink to a resource that includes the required information.\r\nIf requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent reasonably practicable.\r\nShareAlike.\r\nIn addition to the conditions in Section 3(a), if You Share Adapted Material You produce, the following conditions also apply.\r\n\r\nThe Adapter\u2019s License You apply must be a Creative Commons license with the same License Elements, this version or later, or a BY-SA Compatible License.\r\nYou must include the text of, or the URI or hyperlink to, the Adapter's License You apply. You may satisfy this condition in any reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in which You Share Adapted Material.\r\nYou may not offer or impose any additional or different terms or conditions on, or apply any Effective Technological Measures to, Adapted Material that restrict exercise of the rights granted under the Adapter's License You apply.\r\nSection 4 \u2013 Sui Generis Database Rights.\r\n\r\nWhere the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that apply to Your use of the Licensed Material:\r\n\r\nfor the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database;\r\nif You include all or a substantial portion of the database contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material, including for purposes of Section 3(b); and\r\nYou must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database.\r\nFor the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not replace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed Rights include other Copyright and Similar Rights.\r\nSection 5 \u2013 Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.\r\n\r\n Unless otherwise separately undertaken by the Licensor, to the extent possible, the Licensor offers the Licensed Material as-is and as-available, and makes no representations or warranties of any kind concerning the Licensed Material, whether express, implied, statutory, or other.

Where a limitation of liability is not allowed in full or in part, this limitation may not apply to You.\r\nThe disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and waiver of all liability.\r\nSection 6 \u2013 Term and Termination.\r\n\r\nThis Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License terminate automatically.\r\nWhere Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under Section 6(a), it reinstates:\r\n\r\nautomatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the violation; or\r\nupon express reinstatement by the Licensor.\r\nFor the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations of this Public License.\r\nFor the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so will not terminate this Public License.\r\nSections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public License.\r\nSection 7 \u2013 Other Terms and Conditions.\r\n\r\nThe Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.\r\nAny arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License.\r\nSection 8 \u2013 Interpretation.\r\n\r\nFor the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully be made without permission under this Public License.\r\nTo the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and conditions.\r\nNo term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the Licensor.\r\nNothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal processes of any jurisdiction or authority.\r\nCreative Commons is not a party to its public licenses.

Your has a corresponding meaning.\r\nSection 2 \u2013 Scope.\r\n\r\nLicense grant.\r\nSubject to the terms and conditions of this Public License, the Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to:\r\nreproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or in part, for NonCommercial purposes only; and\r\nproduce and reproduce, but not Share, Adapted Material for NonCommercial purposes only.\r\nExceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, where Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public License does not apply, and You do not need to comply with its terms and conditions.\r\nTerm. The term of this Public License is specified in Section 6(a).\r\nMedia and formats; technical modifications allowed. The Licensor authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in all media and formats whether now known or hereafter created, and to make technical modifications necessary to do so. The Licensor waives and\/or agrees not to assert any right or authority to forbid You from making technical modifications necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License, simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)(4) never produces Adapted Material.\r\nDownstream recipients.\r\nOffer from the Licensor \u2013 Licensed Material. Every recipient of the Licensed Material automatically receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this Public License.\r\nNo downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose any additional or different terms or conditions on, or apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed Material.\r\nNo endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by, the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).\r\nOther rights.\r\n\r\nMoral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity, privacy, and\/or other similar personality rights; however, to the extent possible, the Licensor waives and\/or agrees not to assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed Rights, but not otherwise.\r\nPatent and trademark rights are not licensed under this Public License.\r\nTo the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly reserves any right to collect such royalties, including when the Licensed Material is used other than for NonCommercial purposes.\r\nSection 3 \u2013 License Conditions.\r\n\r\nYour exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the following conditions.\r\n\r\nAttribution.\r\n\r\nIf You Share the Licensed Material, You must:\r\n\r\nretain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor with the Licensed Material:\r\nidentification of the creator(s) of the Licensed Material and any others designated to receive attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by the Licensor (including by pseudonym if designated);\r\na copyright notice;\r\na notice that refers to this Public License;\r\na notice that refers to the disclaimer of warranties;\r\na URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the extent reasonably practicable;\r\nindicate if You modified the Licensed Material and retain an indication of any previous modifications; and\r\nindicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this Public License, and include the text of, or the URI or hyperlink to, this Public License.\r\nFor the avoidance of doubt, You do not have permission under this Public License to Share Adapted Material.\r\nYou may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it may be reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or hyperlink to a resource that includes the required information.\r\nIf requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent reasonably practicable.\r\nSection 4 \u2013 Sui Generis Database Rights.\r\n\r\nWhere the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that apply to Your use of the Licensed Material:\r\n\r\nfor the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database for NonCommercial purposes only and provided You do not Share Adapted Material;\r\nif You include all or a substantial portion of the database contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material; and\r\nYou must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database.\r\nFor the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not replace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed Rights include other Copyright and Similar Rights.\r\nSection 5 \u2013 Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.\r\n\r\n Unless otherwise separately undertaken by the Licensor, to the extent possible, the Licensor offers the Licensed Material as-is and as-available, and makes no representations or warranties of any kind concerning the Licensed Material, whether express, implied, statutory, or other. This includes, without limitation, warranties of title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement, absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or the presence or absence of errors, whether or not known or discoverable. Where disclaimers of warranties are not allowed in full or in part, this disclaimer may not apply to You.\r\n To the extent possible, in no event will the Licensor be liable to You on any legal theory (including, without limitation, negligence) or otherwise for any direct, special, indirect, incidental, consequential, punitive, exemplary, or other losses, costs, expenses, or damages arising out of this Public License or use of the Licensed Material, even if the Licensor has been advised of the possibility of such losses, costs, expenses, or damages. Where a limitation of liability is not allowed in full or in part, this limitation may not apply to You.\r\nThe disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and waiver of all liability.\r\nSection 6 \u2013 Term and Termination.\r\n\r\nThis Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License terminate automatically.\r\nWhere Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under Section 6(a), it reinstates:\r\n\r\nautomatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the violation; or\r\nupon express reinstatement by the Licensor.\r\nFor the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations of this Public License.\r\nFor the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so will not terminate this Public License.\r\nSections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public License.\r\nSection 7 \u2013 Other Terms and Conditions.\r\n\r\nThe Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.\r\nAny arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License.\r\nSection 8 \u2013 Interpretation.\r\n\r\nFor the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully be made without permission under this Public License.\r\nTo the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and conditions.\r\nNo term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the Licensor.\r\nNothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal processes of any jurisdiction or authority.\r\nCreative Commons is not a party to its public licenses. Notwithstanding, Creative Commons may elect to apply one of its public licenses to material it publishes and in those instances will be considered the \u201cLicensor.\u201d Except for the limited purpose of indicating that material is shared under a Creative Commons public license or as otherwise permitted by the Creative Commons policies published at creativecommons.org\/policies, Creative Commons does not authorize the use of the trademark \u201cCreative Commons\u201d or any other trademark or logo of Creative Commons without its prior written consent including, without limitation, in connection with any unauthorized modifications to any of its public licenses or any other arrangements, understandings, or agreements concerning use of licensed material.

Likewise, DOC software is provided as is with no warranties of any kind, including the warranties of design, merchantability, and fitness for a particular purpose, noninfringement, or arising from a course of dealing, usage or trade practice. Washington University, UC Irvine, Vanderbilt University, their employees, and students shall have no liability with respect to the infringement of copyrights, trade secrets or any patents by DOC software or any part thereof. Moreover, in no event will Washington University, UC Irvine, or Vanderbilt University, their employees, or students be liable for any lost revenue or profits or other special, indirect and consequential damages.\r\n\r\nDOC software is provided with no support and without any obligation on the part of Washington University, UC Irvine, Vanderbilt University, their employees, or students to assist in its use, correction, modification, or enhancement. A number of companies around the world provide commercial support for DOC software, however. DOC software is Y2K-compliant, as long as the underlying OS platform is Y2K-compliant. Likewise, DOC software is compliant with the new US daylight savings rule passed by Congress as \"The Energy Policy Act of 2005,\" which established new daylight savings times (DST) rules for the United States that expand DST as of March 2007. Since DOC software obtains time\/date and calendaring information from operating systems users will not be affected by the new DST rules as long as they upgrade their operating systems accordingly.\r\n\r\nThe names ACE(TM), TAO(TM), CIAO(TM), DAnCE(TM), CoSMIC(TM), Washington University, UC Irvine, and Vanderbilt University, may not be used to endorse or promote products or services derived from this source without express written permission from Washington University, UC Irvine, or Vanderbilt University.

Distribution Obligations.\r\n\r\n3.1. Application of License.\r\n\r\nThe Modifications which You create or to which You contribute are governed by the terms of this License, including without limitation Section 2.2. The Source Code version of Covered Code may be distributed only under the terms of this License or a future version of this License released under Section 6.1, and You must include a copy of this License with every copy of the Source Code You distribute. You may not offer or impose any terms on any Source Code version that alters or restricts the applicable version of this License or the recipients' rights hereunder. However, You may include an additional document offering the additional rights described in Section 3.5.\r\n\r\n3.2. Availability of Source Code.\r\n\r\nAny Modification which You create or to which You contribute must be made available in Source Code form under the terms of this License either on the same media as an Executable version or via an accepted Electronic Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom you made an Executable version available; and if made available via Electronic Distribution Mechanism, must remain available for at least twelve (12) months after the date it initially became available, or at least six (6) months after a subsequent version of that particular Modification has been made available to such recipients. You are responsible for ensuring that the Source Code version remains available even if the Electronic Distribution Mechanism is maintained by a third party.\r\n\r\n3.3. Description of Modifications.\r\n\r\nYou must cause all Covered Code to which You contribute to contain a file documenting the changes You made to create that Covered Code and the date of any change. You must include a prominent statement that the Modification is derived, directly or indirectly, from Original Code provided by the Initial Developer and including the name of the Initial Developer in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in any notice in an Executable version or related documentation in which You describe the origin or ownership of the Covered Code.\r\n\r\n3.4. Intellectual Property Matters\r\n\r\n(a) Third Party Claims.\r\n\r\nIf Contributor has knowledge that a license under a third party's intellectual property rights is required to exercise the rights granted by such Contributor under Sections 2.1 or 2.2, Contributor must include a text file with the Source Code distribution titled \"LEGAL'' which describes the claim and the party making the claim in sufficient detail that a recipient will know whom to contact. If Contributor obtains such knowledge after the Modification is made available as described in Section 3.2, Contributor shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies Contributor makes available thereafter and shall take other steps (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably calculated to inform those who received the Covered Code that new knowledge has been obtained.\r\n\r\n(b) Contributor APIs.\r\n\r\nIf Contributor's Modifications include an application programming interface and Contributor has knowledge of patent licenses which are reasonably necessary to implement that API, Contributor must also include this information in the LEGAL file.\r\n\r\n(c) Representations.\r\n\r\nContributor represents that, except as disclosed pursuant to Section 3.4(a) above, Contributor believes that Contributor's Modifications are Contributor's original creation(s) and\/or Contributor has sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by this License.\r\n\r\n3.5. Required Notices.\r\n\r\nYou must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source Code. If it is not possible to put such notice in a particular Source Code file due to its structure, then You must include such notice in a location (such as a relevant directory) where a user would be likely to look for such a notice. If You created one or more Modification(s) You may add your name as a Contributor to the notice described in Exhibit A. You must also duplicate this License in any documentation for the Source Code where You describe recipients' rights or ownership rights relating to Covered Code. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Code. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear than any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.\r\n\r\n3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions.\r\n\r\nYou may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the requirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered Code, and if You include a notice stating that the Source Code version of the Covered Code is available under the terms of this License, including a description of how and where You have fulfilled the obligations of Section 3.2. The notice must be conspicuously included in any notice in an Executable version, related documentation or collateral in which You describe recipients' rights relating to the Covered Code. You may distribute the Executable version of Covered Code or ownership rights under a license of Your choice, which may contain terms different from this License, provided that You are in compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the Executable version does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient's rights in the Source Code version from the rights set forth in this License. If You distribute the Executable version under a different license You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ from this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such terms You offer.\r\n\r\n3.7. Larger Works.\r\n\r\nYou may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other code not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code.\r\n\r\n4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.\r\n\r\nIf it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License with respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must be included in the LEGAL file described in Section 3.4 and must be included with all distributions of the Source Code. Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.\r\n\r\n5. Application of this License.\r\n\r\nThis License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has attached the notice in Exhibit A and to related Covered Code.\r\n\r\n6. Versions of the License.\r\n\r\n6.1. New Versions.\r\n\r\nInprise Corporation (''Inprise'') may publish revised and\/or new versions of the License from time to time. Each version will be given a distinguishing version number.\r\n\r\n6.2. Effect of New Versions.\r\n\r\nOnce Covered Code has been published under a particular version of the License, You may always continue to use it under the terms of that version. You may also choose to use such Covered Code under the terms of any subsequent version of the License published by Inprise. No one other than Inprise has the right to modify the terms applicable to Covered Code created under this License.\r\n\r\n6.3. Derivative Works.\r\n\r\nIf You create or use a modified version of this License (which you may only do in order to apply it to code which is not already Covered Code governed by this License), You must (a) rename Your license so that the phrases ''Mozilla'', ''MOZILLAPL'', ''MOZPL'', ''Netscape'', \"MPL\", ''NPL\", \"InterBase\", \"Inprise\", \"Borland'' or any confusingly similar phrase do not appear in your license (except to note that your license differs from this License) and (b) otherwise make it clear that Your version of the license contains terms which differ from the Mozilla Public License and Netscape Public License. (Filling in the name of the Initial Developer, Original Code or Contributor in the notice described in Exhibit A shall not of themselves be deemed to be modifications of this License.)\r\n\r\n6.4 Origin of the InterBase Public License.\r\n\r\nThe InterBase public license is based on the Mozilla Public License V 1.1 with the following changes:\r\n\r\n1. The license is published by Inprise Corporation. Only Inprise Corporation can modify the terms applicable to Covered Code.\r\n2. The license can be modified and used for code which is not already governed by this license. Modified versions of the license must be renamed to avoid confusion with Netscape\u2019s or Inprise\u2019s license and must include a description of changes from the InterBase Public License.\r\n3. The name of the license in Exhibit A is the \"InterBase Public License\".\r\n4. The reference to an alternative license in Exhibit A has been removed.\r\n5. Amendments I, II, III, V, and VI have been deleted.\r\n6. Exhibit A, Netscape Public License has been deleted\r\n7. A new amendment (II) has been added, describing the required and restricted rights to use the trademarks of Inprise Corporation.\r\n\r\n7. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.\r\n\r\nCOVERED CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN \"AS IS'' BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED CODE IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED CODE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED CODE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED CODE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.\r\n\r\n8. TERMINATION.\r\n\r\n8.1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. All sublicenses to the Covered Code which are properly granted shall survive any termination of this License. Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License shall survive.\r\n\r\n8.2. If You initiate litigation by asserting a patent infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions) against Initial Developer or a Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom You file such action is referred to as \"Participant\") alleging that:\r\n\r\n(a) such Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted by such Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and\/or 2.2 of this License shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate prospectively, unless if within 60 days after receipt of notice You either: (i) agree in writing to pay Participant a mutually agreeable reasonable royalty for Your past and future use of Modifications made by such Participant, or (ii) withdraw Your litigation claim with respect to the Contributor Version against such Participant. If within 60 days of notice, a reasonable royalty and payment arrangement are not mutually agreed upon in writing by the parties or the litigation claim is not withdrawn, the rights granted by Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and\/or 2.2 automatically terminate at the expiration of the 60 day notice period specified above.\r\n\r\n(b) any software, hardware, or device, other than such Participant's Contributor Version, directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any rights granted to You by such Participant under Sections 2.1(b) and 2.2(b) are revoked effective as of the date You first made, used, sold, distributed, or had made, Modifications made by that Participant.\r\n\r\n8.3. If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant alleging that such Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as by license or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses granted by such Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken into account in determining the amount or value of any payment or license.\r\n\r\n8.4. In the event of termination under Sections 8.1 or 8.2 above, all end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder prior to termination shall survive termination.\r\n\r\n9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.\r\n\r\nUNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED CODE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\r\n\r\n10. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.\r\n\r\nThe Covered Code is a ''commercial item,'' as that term is defined in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of ''commercial computer software'' and ''commercial computer software documentation,'' as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Code with only those rights set forth herein.\r\n\r\n11. MISCELLANEOUS.\r\n\r\nThis License represents the complete agreement concerning subject matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be governed by Georgia law provisions (except to the extent applicable law, if any, provides otherwise), excluding its conflict-of-law provisions. With respect to disputes in which at least one party is a citizen of, or an entity chartered or registered to do business in the United States of America, Any litigation relating to this License shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Courts of the Northern District of Georgia and\/or the state courts of Gwinnett County, Georgia, with the losing party responsible for costs, including without limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not apply to this License.\r\n\r\n12. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.\r\n\r\nAs between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly, out of its utilization of rights under this License and You agree to work with Initial Developer and Contributors to distribute such responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing herein is intended or shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability.\r\n\r\n13. MULTIPLE-LICENSED CODE.\r\n\r\nInitial Developer may designate portions of the Covered Code as \"Multiple-Licensed\". \"Multiple-Licensed\" means that the Initial Developer permits you to utilize portions of the Covered Code under Your choice of the InterBase Public License or the alternative licenses, if any, specified by the Initial Developer in the file described in Exhibit A.\r\n\r\nEXHIBIT A - InterBase Public License.\r\n\r\n``The contents of this file are subject to the InterBase Public License Version 1.0 (the \"License\"); you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.

We trust you not to abuse our generosity.\r\n\r\nBy Shawn Hargreaves, 18 October 1998.\r\n\r\nDISCLAIMER: THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.

IF YOU DO NOT ACCEPT THEM, DO NOT USE, COPY, MODIFY, NOR (RE)DISTRIBUTE THE SOFTWARE, NOR ANY PART(S) THEREOF.\r\n\r\n\r\nI. Definitions\r\n\r\n1. \"This Product\" means the work (including, but not limited to, source code, graphics, texts, and accompanying files) made available under and governed by this version of this license (\"License\"), as may be indicated by, but is not limited to, copyright notice(s) attached to or included in the work.\r\n\r\n2. \"You\" means (and \"Your\" refers to) an individual or a legal entity (e.g., a non-profit organization, commercial organization, government agency, etc.) exercising permissions granted by this License.\r\n\r\n3. \"Modification\" means (and \"modify\" refers to) any alteration of This Product, including, but not limited to, addition to or deletion from the substance or structure of This Product, translation into another language, repackaging, alteration or removal of any file included with This Product, and addition of any new files to This Product.\r\n\r\n4. \"Your Product\" means This Product modified by You, or any work You derive from (or base on) any part of This Product. In addition, \"Your Product\" means any work in which You include any (modified or unmodified) portion of This Product. However, if the work in which you include it is an aggregate software distribution (such as an operating system distribution or a cover CD-ROM of a magazine) containing multiple separate products, then the term \"Your Product\" includes only those products (in the aggregate software distribution) that use, include, or depend on a modified or unmodified version of This Product (and the term \"Your Product\" does not include the whole aggregate software distribution). For the purposes of this License, a product suite consisting of two or more products is considered a single product (operating system distributions and cover media of magazines are not considered product suites).\r\n\r\n5. \"Distribution\" means (and \"distribute\" refers to), regardless of means or methods, conveyance, transfer, providing, or making available of This\/Your Product or portions thereof to third parties (including, but not limited to, making This\/Your Product, or portions thereof, available for download to third parties, whether or not any third party has downloaded the product, or any portion thereof, made available for download).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII. Use, Copying, and Distribution of This Product\r\n\r\n1. Provided that You comply with all applicable terms and conditions of this License, You may make copies of This Product (unmodified) and distribute copies of This Product (unmodified) that are not included in another product forming Your Product (except as permitted under Chapter III). Note: For terms and conditions for copying and distribution of modified versions of This Product, see Chapter III.\r\n\r\n2. Provided that You comply with all applicable terms and conditions of this License, You may use This Product freely (see also Chapter III) on any number of computers\/systems for non-commercial and\/or commercial purposes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. Modification, Derivation, and Inclusion in Other Products\r\n\r\n1. If all conditions specified in the following paragraphs in this Chapter (III) are met (for exceptions, see Section III.2) and if You comply with all other applicable terms and conditions of this License, You may modify This Product (thus forming Your Product), derive new works from This Product or portions thereof (thus forming Your Product), include This Product or portions thereof in another product (thus forming Your Product, unless defined otherwise in Chapter I), and You may use (for non-commercial and\/or commercial purposes), copy, and\/or distribute Your Product.\r\n\r\n    a. The name of Your Product (or of Your modified version of This Product) must not contain the name TrueCrypt (for example, the following names are not allowed: TrueCrypt, TrueCrypt+, TrueCrypt Professional, iTrueCrypt, etc.) nor any other names confusingly similar to the name TrueCrypt (e.g., True-Crypt, True Crypt, TruKrypt, etc.)\r\n\r\n    All occurrences of the name TrueCrypt that could reasonably be considered to identify Your Product must be removed from Your Product and from any associated materials. Logo(s) included in (or attached to) Your Product (and in\/to associated materials) must not incorporate and must not be confusingly similar to any of the TrueCrypt logos (including, but not limited to, the non-textual logo consisting primarily of a key in stylized form) or portion(s) thereof. All graphics contained in This Product (logos, icons, etc.) must be removed from Your Product (or from Your modified version of This Product) and from any associated materials.\r\n\r\n    b. The following phrases must be removed from Your Product and from any associated materials, except the text of this License: \"A TrueCrypt Foundation Release\", \"Released by TrueCrypt Foundation\", \"This is a TrueCrypt Foundation release.\"\r\n\r\n    c. Phrase \"Based on TrueCrypt, freely available at http:\/\/www.truecrypt.org\/\" must be displayed by Your Product (if technically feasible) and contained in its documentation. Alternatively, if This Product or its portion You included in Your Product constitutes only a minor portion of Your Product, phrase \"Portions of this product are based in part on TrueCrypt, freely available at http:\/\/www.truecrypt.org\/\" may be displayed instead. In each of the cases mentioned above in this paragraph, \"http:\/\/www.truecrypt.org\/\" must be a hyperlink (if technically feasible) pointing to http:\/\/www.truecrypt.org\/ and You may freely choose the location within the user interface (if there is any) of Your Product (e.g., an \"About\" window, etc.) and the way in which Your Product will display the respective phrase.\r\n\r\n    Your Product (and any associated materials, e.g., the documentation, the content of the official web site of Your Product, etc.) must not present any Internet address containing the domain name truecrypt.org (or any domain name that forwards to the domain name truecrypt.org) in a manner that might suggest that it is where information about Your Product may be obtained or where bugs found in Your Product may be reported or where support for Your Product may be available or otherwise attempt to indicate that the domain name truecrypt.org is associated with Your Product.\r\n\r\n    d. The complete source code of Your Product must be freely and publicly available (for exceptions, see Section III.2) at least until You cease to distribute Your Product. This condition can be met in one or both of the following ways:\r\n    (i) You include the complete source code of Your Product with every copy of Your Product that You make and distribute and You make all such copies of Your Product available to the general public free of charge, and\/or\r\n   (ii) You include information (valid and correct at least until You cease to distribute Your Product) about where the complete source code of Your Product can be obtained free of charge (e.g., an Internet address) or for a reasonable reproduction fee with every copy of Your Product that You make and distribute and, if there is a web site officially associated with Your Product, You include the aforementioned information about the source code on a freely and publicly accessible web page to which such web site links via an easily viewable hyperlink (at least until You cease to distribute Your Product).\r\n\r\n    The source code of Your Product must not be deliberately obfuscated and it must not be in an intermediate form (e.g., the output of a preprocessor). Source code means the preferred form in which a programmer would usually modify the program.\r\n\r\n    Portions of the source code of Your Product not contained in This Product (e.g., portions added by You in creating Your Product, whether created by You or by third parties) must be available under license(s) that (however, see also Subsection III.1.e) allow(s) anyone to modify and derive new works from the portions of the source code that are not contained in This Product and to use, copy, and redistribute such modifications and\/or derivative works. The license(s) must be perpetual, non-exclusive, royalty-free, no-charge, and worldwide, and must not invalidate, weaken, restrict, interpret, amend, modify, interfere with or otherwise affect any part, term, provision, or clause of this License. The text(s) of the license(s) must be included with every copy of Your Product that You make and distribute.\r\n\r\n    e. You must not change the license terms of This Product in any way (adding any new terms is considered changing the license terms even if the original terms are retained), which means, e.g., that no part of This Product may be put under another license. You must keep intact all the legal notices contained in the source code files. You must include the following items with every copy of Your Product that You make and distribute: a clear and conspicuous notice stating that Your Product or portion(s) thereof is\/are governed by this version of the TrueCrypt License, a verbatim copy of this version of the TrueCrypt License (as contained herein), a clear and conspicuous notice containing information about where the included copy of the License can be found, and an appropriate copyright notice.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. You are not obligated to comply with Subsection III.1.d if Your Product is not distributed (i.e., Your Product is available only to You).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV. Disclaimer of Liability, Disclaimer of Warranty, Indemnification\r\n\r\nYou expressly acknowledge and agree to the following:\r\n\r\n1. IN NO EVENT WILL ANY (CO)AUTHOR OF THIS PRODUCT, OR ANY APPLICABLE INTELLECTUAL-PROPERTY OWNER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY COPY AND\/OR (RE)DISTRIBUTE THIS PRODUCT OR PORTIONS THEREOF, AS MAY BE PERMITTED HEREIN, BE LIABLE TO YOU OR TO ANY OTHER PARTY FOR ANY DAMAGES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, CORRUPTION OR LOSS OF DATA, ANY LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES, A FAILURE OF THIS PRODUCT TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PRODUCT, PROCUREMENT OF SUBSTITUTE GOODS OR SERVICES, OR BUSINESS INTERRUPTION), WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, TORT (INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHERWISE, ARISING OUT OF THE USE, COPYING, MODIFICATION, OR (RE)DISTRIBUTION OF THIS PRODUCT (OR A PORTION THEREOF) OR OF YOUR PRODUCT (OR A PORTION THEREOF), OR INABILITY TO USE THIS PRODUCT (OR A PORTION THEREOF), EVEN IF SUCH DAMAGES (OR THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES) ARE\/WERE PREDICTABLE OR KNOWN TO ANY (CO)AUTHOR, INTELLECTUAL-PROPERTY OWNER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY.\r\n\r\n2.

Any attempt otherwise to use trademarks associated with (or applying to) This Product automatically and immediately terminates Your rights under This License and may constitute trademark infringement (which may be prosecuted).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI. General Terms and Conditions, Miscellaneous Provisions\r\n\r\n1. ANYONE WHO USES AND\/OR COPIES AND\/OR MODIFIES AND\/OR CREATES DERIVATIVE WORKS OF AND\/OR (RE)DISTRIBUTES THIS PRODUCT, OR ANY PORTION(S) THEREOF, IS, BY SUCH ACTION(S), AGREEING TO BE BOUND BY AND ACCEPTING ALL TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS LICENSE (AND THE RESPONSIBILITIES AND OBLIGATIONS CONTAINED IN THIS LICENSE).

YOU MAY NOT USE, MODIFY, COPY, CREATE DERIVATIVE WORKS OF, (RE)DISTRIBUTE, OR SUBLICENSE THIS PRODUCT, OR PORTION(S) THEREOF, EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY PROVIDED IN THIS LICENSE (EVEN IF APPLICABLE LAW GIVES YOU MORE RIGHTS). ANY ATTEMPT (EVEN IF PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW) OTHERWISE TO USE, MODIFY, COPY, CREATE DERIVATIVE WORKS OF, (RE)DISTRIBUTE, OR SUBLICENSE THIS PRODUCT, OR PORTION(S) THEREOF, AUTOMATICALLY AND IMMEDIATELY TERMINATES YOUR RIGHTS UNDER THIS LICENSE AND CAN CONSTITUTE COPYRIGHT INFRINGEMENT (WHICH MAY BE PROSECUTED). ANY CONDITIONS AND RESTRICTIONS CONTAINED IN THIS LICENSE ARE ALSO LIMITATIONS ON THE SCOPE OF THIS LICENSE AND ALSO DEFINE THE SCOPE OF YOUR RIGHTS UNDER THIS LICENSE. YOUR FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS LICENSE OR FAILURE TO PERFORM ANY APPLICABLE OBLIGATION IMPOSED BY THIS LICENSE AUTOMATICALLY AND IMMEDIATELY TERMINATES YOUR RIGHTS UNDER THIS LICENSE AND CAN CAUSE OR BE CONSIDERED COPYRIGHT INFRINGEMENT (WHICH MAY BE PROSECUTED). NOTHING IN THIS LICENSE SHALL IMPLY OR BE CONSTRUED AS A PROMISE, OBLIGATION, OR COVENANT NOT TO SUE FOR COPYRIGHT OR TRADEMARK INFRINGEMENT IF YOU DO NOT COMPLY WITH THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS LICENSE.\r\n\r\n3.

Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, You may allow a third party to use Your copy of This Product (or a copy that You make and distribute, or Your Product) provided that the third party explicitly accepts and agrees to be bound by all terms and conditions of this License and the third party is not prohibited from using This Product (or portions thereof) by this License (see, e.g., Section VI.7) or by applicable law. However, You are not obligated to ensure that the third party accepts (and agrees to be bound by all terms of) this License if You distribute only the self-extracting package (containing This Product) that does not allow the user to install (nor extract) the files contained in the package until he or she accepts and agrees to be bound by all terms and conditions of this License.\r\n\r\n5. Without specific prior written permission from the authors of This Product (or from their common representative), You must not use the name of This Product, the names of the authors of This Product, or the names of the legal entities (or informal groups) of which the authors were\/are members\/employees, to endorse or promote Your Product or any work in which You include a modified or unmodified version of This Product, or to endorse or promote You or Your affiliates, or in a way that might suggest that Your Product (or any work in which You include a modified or unmodified version of This Product), You, or Your affiliates is\/are endorsed by one or more authors of This Product, or in a way that might suggest that one or more authors of This Product is\/are affiliated with You (or Your affiliates) or directly participated in the creation of Your Product or of any work in which You include a modified or unmodified version of This Product.\r\n\r\n6.

Except as otherwise provided in this License, if any provision of this License, or a portion thereof, is found to be invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of this License, and such invalid or unenforceable provision shall be construed to reflect the original intent of the provision and shall be enforced to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law so as to effect the original intent of the provision as closely as possible.\r\n\r\n____________________________________________________________\r\n\r\n\r\nThird-Party Licenses\r\n\r\nThis Product contains components that were created by third parties and that are governed by third-party licenses, which are contained hereinafter (separated by lines consisting of underscores). Each of the third-party licenses applies only to (portions of) the source code file(s) in which the third-party license is contained or in which it is explicitly referenced, and to compiled or otherwise processed forms of such source code. None of the third-party licenses applies to This Product as a whole, even when it uses terms such as \"product\", \"program\", or any other equivalent terms\/phrases. This Product as a whole is governed by the TrueCrypt License (see above).\r\nSome of the third-party components have been modified by the authors of This Product. Unless otherwise stated, such modifications and additions are governed by the TrueCrypt License (see above).

If you use any of the source code originally by Eric Young, you must in addition follow his terms and conditions.\r\n\r\n4. Nothing requires that you accept this License, as you have not signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the product or its derivative works.\r\n\r\nThese actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.\r\n\r\n5.

Sie ist die technische Grundlage der Informationsgesellschaft. Die Frage der Teilhabe der Allgemeinheit ist deswegen von besonderer Bedeutung. Herk\u00f6mmlich lizenzierte Programme werden nur im Object Code vertrieben, der Nutzer darf das Programm weder ver\u00e4ndern noch weitergeben. Das Lizenzmodell der Freien Software (synonym \"Open Source Software\") gew\u00e4hrt Ihnen dagegen umfassende Freiheiten im Umgang mit dem Programm. Die Deutsche Freie Software Lizenz folgt diesem Lizenzmodell. Sie gew\u00e4hrt Ihnen das Recht, das Programm in umfassender Weise zu nutzen. Es ist Ihnen gestattet, das Programm nach Ihren Vorstellungen zu ver\u00e4ndern, in ver\u00e4nderter oder unver\u00e4nderter Form zu vervielf\u00e4ltigen, zu verbreiten und \u00f6ffentlich zug\u00e4nglich zu machen. Diese Rechte werden unentgeltlich einger\u00e4umt.\r\n\r\nDie Deutsche Freie Software Lizenz verbindet die Rechtseinr\u00e4umung allerdings mit Pflichten, die dem Zweck dienen, das freie Zirkulieren des Programms und aller ver\u00f6ffentlichten Fortentwicklungen zu sichern. Wenn Sie das Programm verbreiten oder \u00f6ffentlich zug\u00e4nglich machen, dann m\u00fcssen Sie jedem, der das Programm von Ihnen erh\u00e4lt, eine Kopie dieser Lizenz mitliefern und den Zugriff auf den Source Code erm\u00f6glichen. Eine weitere Pflicht betrifft Fortentwicklungen des Programms. \u00c4nderungen am Programm, die Sie \u00f6ffentlich verbreiten oder zug\u00e4nglich machen, m\u00fcssen nach den Bestimmungen dieser Lizenz frei gegeben werden.\r\n\r\nDie Deutsche Freie Software Lizenz nimmt auf die besonderen Anforderungen des deutschen und europ\u00e4ischen Rechts R\u00fccksicht. Sie ist zweisprachig gestaltet und damit auch auf den internationalen Vertrieb ausgerichtet.\r\n\r\n\u00a7 0 Definitionen\r\n\r\nDokumentation: Die Beschreibung des Aufbaus und\/oder der Struktur der Programmierung und\/oder der Funktionalit\u00e4ten des Programms, unabh\u00e4ngig davon, ob sie im Source Code oder gesondert vorgenommen wird.\r\n\r\nLizenz: Die zwischen dem Lizenzgeber und Ihnen geschlossene Vereinbarung mit dem Inhalt der \"Deutschen Freien Software Lizenz\" bzw. das Angebot hierzu.\r\n\r\nLizenznehmer: Jede nat\u00fcrliche oder juristische Person, die die Lizenz angenommen hat.\r\n\r\nProgramm: Jedes Computerprogramm, das von den Rechtsinhabern nach den Bestimmungen dieser Lizenz verbreitet oder \u00f6ffentlich zug\u00e4nglich gemacht worden ist.\r\n\r\nObject Code: Die maschinenlesbare, \u00fcbersetzte Form des Programms.\r\n\r\n\u00d6ffentlich: Nicht nur an einen bestimmten Personenkreis gerichtet, der pers\u00f6nlich oder durch die Zugeh\u00f6rigkeit zu einer juristischen Person oder einem \u00f6ffentlichen Tr\u00e4ger miteinander verbunden ist.\r\n\r\n\u00d6ffentlich zug\u00e4nglich machen: Die \u00f6ffentliche Weitergabe des Programms in unk\u00f6rperlicher Form, insbesondere das Bereithalten zum Download in Datennetzen.\r\n\r\nRechtsinhaber: Der bzw. die Urheber oder sonstigen Inhaber der ausschlie\u00dflichen Nutzungsrechte an dem Programm.\r\n\r\nSource Code: Die f\u00fcr Menschen lesbare, in Programmiersprache dargestellte Form des Programms.\r\n\r\nVer\u00e4ndern: Jede Erweiterung, K\u00fcrzung und Bearbeitung des Programms, insbesondere Weiterentwicklungen.\r\n\r\nVerbreiten: Die \u00f6ffentliche Weitergabe k\u00f6rperlicher Vervielf\u00e4ltigungsst\u00fccke, insbesondere auf Datentr\u00e4gern oder in Verbindung mit Hardware.\r\n\r\nVollst\u00e4ndiger Source Code: Der Source Code in der f\u00fcr die Erstellung bzw. die Bearbeitung benutzten Form zusammen mit den zur \u00dcbersetzung und Installation erforderlichen Konfigurationsdateien und Software-Werkzeugen, sofern diese in der ben\u00f6tigten Form nicht allgemein gebr\u00e4uchlich (z.B. Standard-Kompiler) oder f\u00fcr jedermann lizenzgeb\u00fchrenfrei im Internet abrufbar sind.\r\n\r\n\u00a7 1 Rechte\r\n\r\n(1) Sie d\u00fcrfen das Programm in unver\u00e4nderter Form vervielf\u00e4ltigen, verbreiten und \u00f6ffentlich zug\u00e4nglich machen.\r\n\r\n(2) Sie d\u00fcrfen das Programm ver\u00e4ndern und entsprechend ver\u00e4nderte Versionen vervielf\u00e4ltigen, verbreiten und \u00f6ffentlich zug\u00e4nglich machen. Gestattet ist auch die Kombination des Programms oder Teilen hiervon mit anderen Programmen.\r\n\r\n(3) Sie erhalten die Rechte unentgeltlich.\r\n\r\n\u00a7 2 Pflichten beim Vertrieb\r\n\r\n(1) Wenn Sie das Programm verbreiten oder \u00f6ffentlich zug\u00e4nglich machen, sei es in unver\u00e4nderter oder ver\u00e4nderter Form, sei es in einer Kombination mit anderen Programmen oder in Verbindung mit Hardware, dann m\u00fcssen sie mitliefern:\r\n1. alle Vermerke im Source Code und\/oder Object Code, die auf diese Lizenz hinweisen;\r\n2. alle Vermerke im Source Code und\/oder Object Code, die \u00fcber die Urheber des Programms Auskunft geben;\r\n3. einen f\u00fcr den Empf\u00e4nger deutlich wahrnehmbaren Hinweis auf diese Lizenz und die Internetadresse http:\/\/www.d-fsl.de;\r\n4. den vollst\u00e4ndigen Text dieser Lizenz in deutlich wahrnehmbarer Weise.\r\n\r\n(2) Wenn bei der Installation des Programms und\/oder beim Programmstart Lizenz- und\/oder Vertragsbedingungen angezeigt werden, dann m\u00fcssen\r\n1. diese Lizenz,\r\n2. ein Hinweis auf diese Lizenz und\r\n3. ein Hinweis auf den oder die Rechtsinhaber an den ersten unter dieser Lizenz nutzbaren Programmbestandteilen\r\nebenfalls angezeigt werden.\r\n\r\n(3) Sie d\u00fcrfen die Nutzung des Programms nicht von Pflichten oder Bedingungen abh\u00e4ngig machen, die nicht in dieser Lizenz vorgesehen sind.\r\n\r\n(4) Sofern Sie mit dem Programm eine Dokumentation erhalten haben, muss diese Dokumentation entsprechend mitgeliefert werden, es sei denn, die freie Mitlieferung der Dokumentation ist Ihnen aufgrund der Lizenz f\u00fcr die Dokumentation nicht gestattet.\r\n\r\n\u00a7 3 Weitere Pflichten beim Vertrieb ver\u00e4nderter Versionen\r\n\r\n(1) Ver\u00e4nderte Versionen des Programms d\u00fcrfen Sie nur unter den Bedingungen dieser Lizenz verbreiten oder \u00f6ffentlich zug\u00e4nglich machen, so dass Dritte das ver\u00e4nderte Programm insgesamt unter dieser Lizenz nutzen k\u00f6nnen.\r\n\r\n(2) Wird das Programm oder ein Teil hiervon mit einem anderen Programm kombiniert, gilt auch die Kombination insgesamt als eine ver\u00e4nderte Version des Programms, es sei denn, das andere Programm ist formal und inhaltlich eigenst\u00e4ndig. Ein anderes Programm ist dann als eigenst\u00e4ndig anzusehen, wenn es die folgenden Voraussetzungen alle erf\u00fcllt:\r\n1. Der Source Code der kombinierten Programme muss jeweils in eigenen Dateien vorhanden sein, die keine Bestandteile des anderen Teils enthalten, die \u00fcber die zur Programmkombination \u00fcblichen und erforderlichen Informationen \u00fcber den anderen Teil hinausgehen, wobei der Source Code des anderen Programms nicht mitgeliefert werden muss.\r\n2. Der mit dem Programm kombinierte Teil muss auch dann sinnvoll nutzbar sein, wenn er nicht mit dem Programm kombiniert wird, und zwar entweder alleine oder mit sonstigen Programmen. Was als \"sinnvoll nutzbar\" anzusehen ist, richtet sich nach der Auffassung der betroffenen Fachkreise. Zu den betroffenen Fachkreisen geh\u00f6ren alle Personen, die das Programm oder Programme mit vergleichbarer Funktionalit\u00e4t entwickeln, benutzen, verbreiten oder \u00f6ffentlich zug\u00e4nglich machen.\r\n\r\n(3) Wenn Sie das Programm oder einen Teil hiervon - ver\u00e4ndert oder unver\u00e4ndert - zusammen mit einem anderen Programm verbreiten oder \u00f6ffentlich zug\u00e4nglich machen, das unter der GNU General Public License (GPL) lizenziert wird, darf das Programm auch unter den Bedingungen der GPL genutzt werden, sofern es mit dem anderen Programm ein \"derivative work\" im Sinne der GPL bildet. Dabei sollen die Hinweise auf diese Lizenz entfernt und durch einen Hinweis auf die GPL ersetzt werden. Ob bei der Zusammenstellung ein \"derivate work\" im Sinne der GPL entsteht, beurteilt sich nach Ziffer 2 b) der GPL. Diese Bestimmung lautet: \"You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.\" Die GPL kann abgerufen werden unter http:\/\/www.fsf.org\/licenses\/gpl.\r\n\r\n(4) Wenn Sie das Programm in einer ver\u00e4nderten Form verbreiten oder \u00f6ffentlich zug\u00e4nglich machen, m\u00fcssen Sie im Source Code einen Hinweis mit den \u00c4nderungen aufnehmen und mit dem Datum der \u00c4nderung versehen. Der Hinweis muss erkennen lassen, welche \u00c4nderungen vorgenommen wurden und bestehende Vermerke, die \u00fcber die Urheber des Programms Auskunft geben, \u00fcbernehmen. Dies gilt unabh\u00e4ngig davon, ob Sie einen eigenen Urhebervermerk hinzuf\u00fcgen. Anstelle eines Hinweises im Source Code k\u00f6nnen Sie auch ein Versionskontrollsystem verwenden oder weiterf\u00fchren, sofern dieses mitverbreitet wird oder \u00f6ffentlich zug\u00e4nglich ist.\r\n\r\n(5) Sie d\u00fcrfen von Dritten f\u00fcr die Einr\u00e4umung eines einfachen Nutzungsrechts an ver\u00e4nderten Versionen des Programms kein Entgelt verlangen.\r\n\r\n(6) Wenn Sie an der ver\u00e4nderten Version des Programms ein anderes Schutzrecht als ein Urheberrecht erwerben, insbesondere ein Patent oder Gebrauchsmuster, lizenzieren Sie dieses Schutzrecht f\u00fcr ver\u00e4nderte und unver\u00e4nderte Versionen des Programms in dem Umfang, der erforderlich ist, um die Rechte aus dieser Lizenz wahrnehmen zu k\u00f6nnen.\r\n\r\n\u00a7 4 Weitere Pflichten beim Vertrieb im Object Code\r\n\r\n(1) Wenn Sie das Programm nur im Object Code verbreiten, dann m\u00fcssen Sie zus\u00e4tzlich zu den in \u00a7 2 und \u00a7 3 geregelten Pflichten entweder\r\n1. den vollst\u00e4ndigen Source Code im Internet \u00f6ffentlich zug\u00e4nglich machen und bei der Verbreitung des Object Codes deutlich auf die vollst\u00e4ndige Internetadresse hinweisen, unter der der Source Code abgerufen werden kann oder\r\n2. den vollst\u00e4ndigen Source Code auf einem hierf\u00fcr \u00fcblichen Datentr\u00e4ger unter Beachtung der \u00a7\u00a7 2 und 3 mitverbreiten.\r\n\r\n(2) Wenn Sie das Programm im Object Code \u00f6ffentlich zug\u00e4nglich machen, dann m\u00fcssen Sie zus\u00e4tzlich zu den in \u00a7 2 und \u00a7 3 geregelten Pflichten den vollst\u00e4ndigen Source Code im Internet \u00f6ffentlich zug\u00e4nglich machen und dabei deutlich auf die vollst\u00e4ndige Internetadresse hinweisen.\r\n\r\n(3) Sofern Sie mit dem Programm eine Dokumentation erhalten haben, muss diese Dokumentation entsprechend der Abs\u00e4tze 1 und 2 mitgeliefert werden, es sei denn, die freie Mitlieferung der Dokumentation ist Ihnen aufgrund der Lizenz f\u00fcr die Dokumentation nicht gestattet.\r\n\r\n\u00a7 5 Vertragsschluss\r\n\r\n(1) Mit dieser Lizenz wird Ihnen und jeder anderen Person ein Angebot auf Abschluss eines Vertrages \u00fcber die Nutzung des Programms unter den Bedingungen der Deutschen Freien Softwarelizenz unterbreitet.\r\n\r\n(2) Sie d\u00fcrfen das Programm nach den jeweils anwendbaren gesetzlichen Vorschriften bestimmungsgem\u00e4\u00df benutzen, ohne dass es der Annahme dieser Lizenz bedarf. Dieses Recht umfasst in der Europ\u00e4ischen Union und in den meisten anderen Rechtsordnungen insbesondere die folgenden Befugnisse:\r\n1. das Programm ablaufen zu lassen sowie die Erstellung von hierf\u00fcr erforderlichen Vervielf\u00e4ltigungen im Haupt- und Arbeitsspeicher;\r\n2. das Erstellen einer Sicherungskopie;\r\n3. die Fehlerberichtigung;\r\n4. die Weitergabe einer rechtm\u00e4\u00dfig erworbenen k\u00f6rperlichen Kopie des Programms.\r\n\r\n(3) Sie erkl\u00e4ren Ihre Zustimmung zum Abschluss dieser Lizenz, indem Sie das Programm verbreiten, \u00f6ffentlich zug\u00e4nglich machen, ver\u00e4ndern oder in einer Weise vervielf\u00e4ltigen, die \u00fcber die bestimmungsgem\u00e4\u00dfe Nutzung im Sinne von Absatz 2 hinausgeht. Ab diesem Zeitpunkt ist diese Lizenz als rechtlich verbindlicher Vertrag zwischen den Rechtsinhabern und Ihnen geschlossen, ohne dass es eines Zugangs der Annahmeerkl\u00e4rung bei den Rechtsinhabern bedarf.\r\n\r\n(4) Sie und jeder andere Lizenznehmer erhalten die Rechte aus dieser Lizenz direkt von den Rechtsinhabern. Eine Unterlizenzierung oder \u00dcbertragung der Rechte ist nicht gestattet.\r\n\r\n\u00a7 6 Beendigung der Rechte bei Zuwiderhandlung\r\n\r\n(1) Jede Verletzung Ihrer Verpflichtungen aus dieser Lizenz f\u00fchrt zu einer automatischen Beendigung Ihrer Rechte aus dieser Lizenz.\r\n\r\n(2) Die Rechte Dritter, die das Programm oder Rechte an dem Programm von Ihnen erhalten haben, bleiben hiervon unber\u00fchrt.\r\n\r\n\u00a7 7 Haftung und Gew\u00e4hrleistung\r\n\r\n(1) F\u00fcr entgegenstehende Rechte Dritter haften die Rechtsinhaber nur, sofern sie Kenntnis von diesen Rechten hatten, ohne Sie zu informieren.\r\n\r\n(2) Die Haftung f\u00fcr Fehler und sonstige M\u00e4ngel des Programms richtet sich nach den au\u00dferhalb dieser Lizenz getroffenen Vereinbarungen zwischen Ihnen und den Rechtsinhabern oder, wenn eine solche Vereinbarung nicht existiert, nach den gesetzlichen Regelungen.\r\n\r\n\u00a7 8 Vertr\u00e4ge mit Dritten\r\n\r\n(1) Diese Lizenz regelt nur die Beziehung zwischen Ihnen und den Rechtsinhabern. Sie ist nicht Bestandteil der Vertr\u00e4ge zwischen Ihnen und Dritten.\r\n\r\n(2) Die Lizenz beschr\u00e4nkt Sie nicht in der Freiheit, mit Dritten, die von Ihnen Kopien des Programms erhalten oder Leistungen in Anspruch nehmen, die im Zusammenhang mit dem Programm stehen, Vertr\u00e4ge beliebigen Inhalts zu schlie\u00dfen, sofern Sie dabei Ihren Verpflichtungen aus dieser Lizenz nachkommen und die Rechte der Dritten aus dieser Lizenz nicht beeintr\u00e4chtigt werden. Insbesondere d\u00fcrfen Sie f\u00fcr die \u00dcberlassung des Programms oder sonstige Leistungen ein Entgelt verlangen.\r\n\r\n(3) Diese Lizenz verpflichtet Sie nicht, das Programm an Dritte weiterzugeben.

        "rf_text": "Yahoo! Public License, Version 1.0 (YPL)\r\n\r\nThis Yahoo! Public License (this \"Agreement\") is a legal agreement that describes the terms under which Yahoo! Inc., a Delaware corporation having its principal place of business at 701 First Avenue, Sunnyvale, California 94089 (\"Yahoo!\") will provide software to you via download or otherwise (\"Software\"). By using the Software, you, an individual or an entity (\"You\") agree to the terms of this Agreement.\r\n\r\nIn consideration of the mutual promises and upon the terms and conditions set forth below, the parties agree as follows:\r\n\r\n1. Grant of Copyright License\r\n\r\n1.1 - Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Yahoo! hereby grants to You, under any and all of its copyright interest in and to the Software, a royalty-free, non-exclusive, non-transferable license to copy, modify, compile, execute, and distribute the Software and Modifications. For the purposes of this Agreement, any change to, addition to, or abridgement of the Software made by You is a \"Modification;\" however, any file You add to the Software that does not contain any part of the Software is not a \"Modification.\"\r\n\r\n1.2 - If You are an individual acting on behalf of a corporation or other entity, Your use of the Software or any Modification is subject to Your having the authority to bind such corporation or entity to this Agreement. Providing copies to persons within such corporation or entity is not considered distribution for purposes of this Agreement.\r\n\r\n1.3 - For the Software or any Modification You distribute in source code format, You must do so only under the terms of this Agreement, and You must include a complete copy of this Agreement with Your distribution. With respect to any Modification You distribute in source code format, the terms of this Agreement will apply to You in the same way those terms apply to Yahoo! with respect to the Software. In other words, when You are distributing Modifications under this Agreement, You \"stand in the shoes\" of Yahoo! in terms of the rights You grant and how the terms and conditions apply to You and the licensees of Your Modifications. Notwithstanding the foregoing, when You \"stand in the shoes\" of Yahoo!, You are not subject to the jurisdiction provision under Section 7, which requires all disputes under this Agreement to be subject to the jurisdiction of federal or state courts of northern California.\r\n\r\n1.4 - For the Software or any Modification You distribute in compiled or object code format, You must also provide recipients with access to the Software or Modification in source code format along with a complete copy of this Agreement. The distribution of the Software or Modifications in compiled or object code format may be under a license of Your choice, provided that You are in compliance with the terms of this Agreement. In addition, You must make absolutely clear that any license terms applying to such Software or Modification that differ from this Agreement are offered by You alone and not by Yahoo!, and that such license does not restrict recipients from exercising rights in the source code to the Software granted by Yahoo! under this Agreement or rights in the source code to any Modification granted by You as described in Section 1.3.\r\n\r\n1.5 - This Agreement does not limit Your right to distribute files that are entirely Your own work (i.e., which do not incorporate any portion of the Software and are not Modifications) under any terms You choose.\r\n\r\n2. Support\r\nYahoo! has no obligation to provide technical support or updates to You. Nothing in this Agreement requires Yahoo! to enter into any license with You for any other edition of the Software.\r\n\r\n3. Intellectual Property Rights\r\n\r\n3.1 - Except for the license expressly granted under copyright in Section 1.1, no rights, licenses or forbearances are granted or may arise in relation to this Agreement whether expressly, by implication, exhaustion, estoppel or otherwise. All rights, including all intellectual property rights, that are not expressly granted under this Agreement are hereby reserved.\r\n\r\n3.2 - In any copy of the Software or in any Modification you create, You must retain and reproduce, any and all copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices that are included in the Software in the same form as they appear in the Software. This includes the preservation of attribution notices in the form of trademarks or logos that exist within a user interface of the Software.\r\n\r\n3.3 - This license does not grant You rights to use any party's name, logo, or trademarks, except solely as necessary to comply with Section 3.2.\r\n\r\n4. Disclaimer of Warranties\r\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\" AND WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND. YAHOO! MAKES NO WARRANTIES, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED, OR STATUTORY REGARDING OR RELATING TO THE SOFTWARE. SPECIFICALLY, YAHOO! DOES NOT WARRANT THAT THE SOFTWARE WILL BE ERROR FREE OR WILL PERFORM IN AN UNINTERRUPTED MANNER. TO THE GREATEST EXTENT ALLOWED BY LAW, YAHOO! SPECIFICALLY DISCLAIMS ALL IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE (EVEN IF YAHOO! HAD BEEN INFORMED OF SUCH PURPOSE), AND NONINFRINGEMENT WITH RESPECT TO THE SOFTWARE, ANY MODIFICATIONS THERETO AND WITH RESPECT TO THE USE OF THE FOREGOING.\r\n\r\n5. Limitation of Liability\r\nIN NO EVENT WILL YAHOO! BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY KIND (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOSS OF PROFITS, LOSS OF USE, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, LOSS OF DATA, COST OF COVER) IN CONNECTION WITH OR ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THE FURNISHING, PERFORMANCE OR USE OF THE SOFTWARE OR ANY OTHER RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, WHETHER ALLEGED AS A BREACH OF CONTRACT OR TORTIOUS CONDUCT, INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE, AND EVEN IF YAHOO! HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\r\n\r\n6. Term and Termination\r\n\r\n6.1 - This Agreement will continue in effect unless and until terminated earlier pursuant to this Section 6.\r\n\r\n6.2 - In the event Yahoo! determines that You have breached this Agreement, Yahoo! may terminate this Agreement.\r\n\r\n6.3 - All licenses granted hereunder shall terminate upon the termination of this Agreement. Termination will be in addition to any rights and remedies available to Yahoo! at law or equity or under this Agreement.\r\n\r\n6.4 - Termination of this Agreement will not affect the provisions regarding reservation of rights (Section 3.1), provisions disclaiming or limiting Yahoo!'s liability (Sections 4 and 5), Termination (Section 6) or Miscellaneous (Section 7), which provisions will survive termination of this Agreement.\r\n\r\n7. Miscellaneous\r\nThis Agreement contains the entire agreement of the parties with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement and supersedes all previous communications, representations, understandings and agreements, either oral or written, between the parties with respect to said subject matter. The relationship of the parties hereunder is that of independent contractors, and this Agreement will not be construed as creating an agency, partnership, joint venture or any other form of legal association between the parties. If any term, condition, or provision in this Agreement is found to be invalid, unlawful or unenforceable to any extent, this Agreement will be construed in a manner that most closely effectuates the intent of this Agreement. Such invalid term, condition or provision will be severed from the remaining terms, conditions and provisions, which will continue to be valid and enforceable to the fullest extent permitted by law. This Agreement will be interpreted and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California and the United States of America, without regard to conflict of law principles. The U.N. Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods shall not apply to this Agreement. All disputes arising out of this Agreement involving Yahoo! or any of its subsidiaries shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the federal or state courts of northern California, with venue lying in Santa Clara County, California. No rights may be assigned, no obligations may be delegated, and this Agreement may not be transferred by You, in whole or in part, whether voluntary or by operation of law, including by way of sale of assets, merger or consolidation, without the prior written consent of Yahoo!, and any purported assignment, delegation or transfer without such consent shall be void ab initio. Any waiver of the provisions of this Agreement or of a party's rights or remedies under this Agreement must be in writing to be effective. Failure, neglect or delay by a party to enforce the provisions of this Agreement or its rights or remedies at any time, will not be construed or be deemed to be a waiver of such party's rights under this Agreement and will not in any way affect the validity of the whole or any part of this Agreement or prejudice such party's right to take subsequent action.",

The Source Code\r\nversion of Covered Code may be distributed only under the\r\nterms of this License or a future version of this License\r\nreleased under Section 6.1, and You must include a copy of\r\nthis License with every copy of the Source Code You\r\ndistribute. You may not offer or impose any terms on any\r\nSource Code version that alters or restricts the applicable\r\nversion of this License or the recipients' rights hereunder.\r\nHowever, You may include an additional document offering the\r\nadditional rights described in Section 3.5.\r\n\r\n     3.2. Availability of Source Code.\r\n     Any Modification which You create or to which You\r\ncontribute must be made available in Source Code form under\r\nthe terms of this License via an accepted Electronic\r\nDistribution Mechanism to anyone to whom you made an\r\nExecutable version available and to the Initial Developer;\r\nand if made available via Electronic Distribution Mechanism,\r\nmust remain available for at least twelve (12) months after\r\nthe date it initially became available, or at least six (6)\r\nmonths after a subsequent version of that particular\r\nModification has been made available to such recipients. You\r\nare responsible for ensuring that the Source Code version\r\nremains available even if the Electronic Distribution\r\nMechanism is maintained by a third party. You are\r\nresponsible for notifying the Initial Developer of the\r\nModification and the location of the Source if a contact\r\nmeans is provided. Cygnus will be acting as maintainer of\r\nthe Source and may provide an Electronic Distribution\r\nmechanism for the Modification to be made available. You can\r\ncontact Cygnus to make the Modification available and to\r\nnotify the Initial Developer. (http:\/\/sourceware.cygnus.com\/ecos)\r\n\r\n     3.3.

You must\r\ninclude a prominent statement that the Modification is\r\nderived, directly or indirectly, from Original Code provided\r\nby the Initial Developer and including the name of the\r\nInitial Developer in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in any\r\nnotice in an Executable version or related documentation in\r\nwhich You describe the origin or ownership of the Covered\r\nCode.\r\n\r\n     3.4. Intellectual Property Matters\r\n\r\n          (a) Third Party Claims.\r\n          If You have knowledge that a party claims an\r\nintellectual property right in particular functionality or\r\ncode (or its utilization under this License), you must\r\ninclude a text file with the source code distribution titled\r\n\"LEGAL\" which describes the claim and the party making the\r\nclaim in sufficient detail that a recipient will know whom\r\nto contact. If you obtain such knowledge after You make Your\r\nModification available as described in Section 3.2, You\r\nshall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies You make\r\navailable thereafter and shall take other steps (such as\r\nnotifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups)\r\nreasonably calculated to inform those who received the\r\nCovered Code that new knowledge has been obtained.\r\n\r\n          (b) Contributor APIs.\r\n          If Your Modification is an application programming\r\ninterface and You own or control patents which are\r\nreasonably necessary to implement that API, you must also\r\ninclude this information in the LEGAL file.\r\n\r\n     3.5. Required Notices.\r\n     You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file\r\nof the Source Code, and this License in any documentation\r\nfor the Source Code, where You describe recipients' rights\r\nrelating to Covered Code. If You created one or more\r\nModification(s), You may add your name as a Contributor to\r\nthe Source Code. If it is not possible to put such notice in\r\na particular Source Code file due to its structure, then you\r\nmust include such notice in a location (such as a relevant\r\ndirectory file) where a user would be likely to look for\r\nsuch a notice. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee\r\nfor, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations\r\nto one or more recipients of Covered Code.\r\n     However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not\r\non behalf of the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You\r\nmust make it absolutely clear that any such warranty,\r\nsupport, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You\r\nalone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial\r\nDeveloper and every Contributor for any liability incurred\r\nby the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of\r\nwarranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.\r\n\r\n     3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions.\r\n     You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only\r\nif the requirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for\r\nthat Covered Code, and if You include a notice stating that\r\nthe Source Code version of the Covered Code is available\r\nunder the terms of this License, including a description of\r\nhow and where You have fulfilled the obligations of Section\r\n3.2. The notice must be conspicuously included in any notice\r\nin an Executable version, related documentation or\r\ncollateral in which You describe recipients' rights relating\r\nto the Covered Code. You may distribute the Executable\r\nversion of Covered Code under a license of Your choice,\r\nwhich may contain terms different from this License,\r\nprovided that You are in compliance with the terms of this\r\nLicense and that the license for the Executable version does\r\nnot attempt to limit or alter the recipient's rights in the\r\nSource Code version from the rights set forth in this\r\nLicense. If You distribute the Executable version under a\r\ndifferent license You must make it absolutely clear that any\r\nterms which differ from this License are offered by You\r\nalone, not by the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You\r\nhereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every\r\nContributor for any liability incurred by the Initial\r\nDeveloper or such Contributor as a result of any such terms\r\nYou offer.\r\n     If you distribute executable versions containing\r\nCovered Code, you must reproduce the notice in Exhibit B in\r\nthe documentation and\/or other materials provided with the\r\nproduct.\r\n\r\n     3.7. Larger Works.\r\n     You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code\r\nwith other code not governed by the terms of this License\r\nand distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In such\r\na case, You must make sure the requirements of this License\r\nare fulfilled for the Covered Code.\r\n\r\n4. INABILITY TO COMPLY DUE TO STATUTE OR REGULATION.\r\n\r\n     If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the\r\nterms of this License with respect to some or all of the\r\nCovered Code due to statute or regulation then You must: (a)\r\ncomply with the terms of this License to the maximum extent\r\npossible; (b) cite the statute or regulation that prohibits\r\nyou from adhering to the license; and (c) describe the\r\nlimitations and the code they affect. Such description must\r\nbe included in the LEGAL file described in Section 3.4 and\r\nmust be included with all distributions of the Source Code.\r\nExcept to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation,\r\nsuch description must be sufficiently detailed for a\r\nrecipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it. You\r\nmust submit this LEGAL file to Cygnus for review, and You\r\nwill not be able use the covered code in any means until\r\npermission is granted from Cygnus to allow for the inability\r\nto comply due to statute or regulation.\r\n\r\n5. APPLICATION OF THIS LICENSE.\r\n\r\n     This License applies to code to which the Initial\r\nDeveloper has attached the notice in Exhibit A, and to\r\nrelated Covered Code.\r\n      Cygnus may include Covered Code in products without\r\nsuch additional products becoming subject to the terms of\r\nthis License, and may license such additional products on\r\ndifferent terms from those contained in this License.\r\n     Cygnus may license the Source Code of Cygnus's Branded\r\nCode without Cygnus's Branded Code becoming subject to the\r\nterms of this License, and may license Cygnus's Branded Code\r\non different terms from those contained in this License.\r\nContact Cygnus for details of alternate licensing terms\r\navailable.\r\n\r\n6. VERSIONS OF THE LICENSE.\r\n\r\n     6.1. New Versions.\r\n     Cygnus may publish revised and\/or new versions of the\r\nLicense from time to time. Each version will be given a\r\ndistinguishing version number.\r\n\r\n     6.2. Effect of New Versions.\r\n     Once Covered Code has been published under a particular\r\nversion of the License, You may always continue to use it\r\nunder the terms of that version. You may also choose to use\r\nsuch Covered Code under the terms of any subsequent version\r\nof the License published by Cygnus. No one other than Cygnus\r\nhas the right to modify the terms applicable to Covered Code\r\nbeyond what is granted under this and subsequent Licenses.\r\n\r\n     6.3. Derivative Works.\r\n     If you create or use a modified version of this License\r\n(which you may only do in order to apply it to code which is\r\nnot already Covered Code governed by this License), you must\r\n(a) rename Your license so that the phrases \"ECOS\", \"eCos\",\r\n\"Cygnus\", \"CPL\" or any confusingly similar phrase do not\r\nappear anywhere in your license and (b) otherwise make it\r\nclear that your version of the license contains terms which\r\ndiffer from the eCos Public License and Cygnus Public\r\nLicense. (Filling in the name of the Initial Developer,\r\nOriginal Code or Contributor in the notice described in\r\nExhibit A shall not of themselves be deemed to be\r\nmodifications of this License.)\r\n\r\n7.

It applies to a given file (the \"Runtime Library\") that bears a notice placed by the copyright holder of the file stating that the file is governed by GPLv3 along with this Exception. \r\n\r\nWhen you use GCC to compile a program, GCC may combine portions of certain GCC header files and runtime libraries with the compiled program. The purpose of this Exception is to allow compilation of non-GPL (including proprietary) programs to use, in this way, the header files and runtime libraries covered by this Exception. \r\n\r\n0. Definitions. \r\nA file is an \"Independent Module\" if it either requires the Runtime Library for execution after a Compilation Process, or makes use of an interface provided by the Runtime Library, but is not otherwise based on the Runtime Library. \r\n\"GCC\" means a version of the GNU Compiler Collection, with or without modifications, governed by version 3 (or a specified later version) of the GNU General Public License (GPL) with the option of using any subsequent versions published by the FSF. \r\n\"GPL-compatible Software\" is software whose conditions of propagation, modification and use would permit combination with GCC in accord with the license of GCC. \r\n\r\n\"Target Code\" refers to output from any compiler for a real or virtual target processor architecture, in executable form or suitable for input to an assembler, loader, linker and\/or execution phase. Notwithstanding that, Target Code does not include data in any format that is used as a compiler intermediate representation, or used for producing a compiler intermediate representation. \r\nThe \"Compilation Process\" transforms code entirely represented in non-intermediate languages designed for human-written code, and\/or in Java Virtual Machine byte code, into Target Code. Thus, for example, use of source code generators and preprocessors need not be considered part of the Compilation Process, since the Compilation Process can be understood as starting with the output of the generators or preprocessors. \r\n\r\nA Compilation Process is \"Eligible\" if it is done using GCC, alone or with other GPL-compatible software, or if it is done without using any work based on GCC. For example, using non-GPL-compatible Software to optimize any GCC intermediate representations would not qualify as an Eligible Compilation Process. \r\n\r\n1. Grant of Additional Permission. \r\nYou have permission to propagate a work of Target Code formed by combining the Runtime Library with Independent Modules, even if such propagation would otherwise violate the terms of GPLv3, provided that all Target Code was generated by Eligible Compilation Processes. You may then convey such a combination under terms of your choice, consistent with the licensing of the Independent Modules. \r\n\r\n2. No Weakening of GCC Copyleft. \r\nThe availability of this Exception does not imply any general presumption that third-party software is unaffected by the copyleft requirements of the license of GCC.",
